AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy of needle retaining after electroacupuncture 
      combined with cognitive training and electroacupuncture combined with cognitive 
      training in the treatment of post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI). METHODS: A 
      total of 206 patients with PSCI were randomized into a needle retaining group 
      (103 cases, 9 cases dropped out) and an electroacupuncture group (103 cases, 6 
      cases dropped out). In addition to the conventional basic medical treatment and 
      the rehabilitation treatment, in the needle retaining group, electroacupuncture 
      at Shenting (GV 24) and Baihui (GV 20) was applied, with continuous wave of 50 Hz 
      in the first 15 min and with disperse-dense wave of 2 Hz/50 Hz in the last 15 
      min, the needles were continuously retained for 1 h after electroacupuncture, 
      during which cognitive training was adopted; in the electroacupuncture group, 
      cognitive training was performed after the same electric stimulation exerted for 
      30 min, without additional needles retaining. The treatment was given once a day, 
      5 times a week for totally 8 weeks in the two groups. Before and after 8-week 
      treatment, the TCM syndrome score was observed; before and after 4,8-week 
      treatment, the scores of mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Montreal cognitive 
      assessment (MoCA) and ability of daily living were observed in the two groups. 
      The clinical efficacy of the two groups was evaluated after 8-week treatment. 
      RESULTS: After 8-week treatment, the TCM syndrome scores were increased compared 
      with those before treatment in both groups (P<0.05); the TCM syndrome score in 
      the needle retaining group was higher than that in the electroacupuncture group 
      (P<0.05).After 4,8-week treatment, the scores of MMSE, MoCA and ability of daily 
      living were increased compared with those before treatment in both groups 
      (P<0.05); MMSE, MoCA scores after 4,8-week treatment and ability of daily living 
      score after 8-week treatment in the needle retaining group were higher than those 
      in the electroacupuncture group (P<0.05). The total effective rate was 90.4% 
      (85/94) in the needle retaining group, which was superior to 82.5% (80/97) in the 
      electroacupuncture group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Both needle retaining after 
      electroacupuncture combined with cognitive training and electroacupuncture 
      combined with cognitive training can effectively treat PSCI, improve the clinical 
      symptom, cognitive function and ability of daily living in PSCI patients. Needle 
      retaining after electroacupuncture combined with cognitive training has a better 
      therapeutic effect.

TI  - Long-Term Effectiveness of Dupilumab in Patients with Atopic Dermatitis: Results 
      up to 3 Years from the RELIEVE-AD Study.
PG  - 2107-2120
LID - 10.1007/s13555-023-00965-5 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Atopic dermatitis (AD) can require long-term therapy. Few 
      real-world studies have evaluated long-term effectiveness from the patients' 
      perspective. The aim of this study was to evaluate patient-reported outcomes 
      (PROs) during long-term dupilumab treatment. METHODS: Adults with 
      moderate-to-severe AD who initiated dupilumab through the US manufacturer patient 
      support program and participated in RELIEVE-AD (a prospective patient survey 
      study with a 12-month follow-up) were recontacted 30-36 months post-initiation 
      regardless of current dupilumab use. The online questionnaire consisted of PROs, 
      including the Atopic Dermatitis Control Tool (ADCT), use of concomitant AD 
      therapies, satisfaction with current therapy, global change in itch relative to 
      before dupilumab initiation, non-itch skin symptoms (skin pain/soreness, 
      hot/burning feeling, and sensitivity to touch), flares, Dermatology Life Quality 
      Index, sleep problems, and the AD-specific Work Productivity and Activity 
      Impairment Questionnaire. RESULTS: Of 698 patients who initiated dupilumab 
      (baseline) and were recontacted, 425 completed the 30-36-month survey. 
      Significant reductions from baseline were reported in concomitant AD therapy use 
      (P < 0.05); 54.4% reported not using other AD medications vs. 12.8% at baseline. 
      At 30-36 months, all results (non-itch skin symptoms, flares, sleep problems, 
      health-related quality of life work/activity impairment, disease control, and 
      treatment satisfaction) were similar to or incrementally better than the 12-month 
      timepoint, with significant improvements vs. baseline (P < 0.001). Global change 
      in itch was reported as "very much better" by 75.3% of respondents. Adequate 
      disease control (score < 7 on ADCT) was reported by 80.7% of respondents, and 
      86.8% were satisfied with the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In clinical practice 
      settings, patient-reported benefits of dupilumab were maintained in survey 
      respondents during long-term treatment up to 36 months while the use of 
      concomitant AD therapies reduced.

OAB - Atopic dermatitis (also known as eczema) is a chronic skin disease that can have 
      a profoundly negative effect on patients' quality of life. To control disease 
      symptoms, patients often need long-term treatment. Dupilumab is a treatment that 
      has shown benefits in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) when 
      used in long-term (under 4 years) clinical trials; however, few studies have 
      evaluated patients' experiences of long-term dupilumab treatment outside of a 
      clinical trial setting. This study was conducted to do so: 425 adults with 
      moderate-to-severe AD who received dupilumab through a US manufacturer patient 
      support program filled in an online questionnaire 30-36 months after starting 
      treatment. The questionnaire included items on use of additional AD therapies, AD 
      symptoms, quality of life, disease control, and satisfaction with treatment. 
      Patients' responses showed that, at 30-36 months after starting dupilumab 
      treatment, 54% of patients reported not using any other medications for AD vs. 
      13% of patients when starting dupilumab treatment. In addition, since starting 
      dupilumab, 75% of patients reported one of the most burdensome AD symptoms, itch, 
      as being "very much better" vs. before starting treatment; 81% reported control 
      of AD symptoms; 85% reported a meaningful improvement in quality of life; and 76% 
      were "extremely" or "very" satisfied with the treatment. In summary, this study 
      showed that long-term dupilumab treatment provides continued improvement in 
      symptoms, treatment satisfaction, disease control, and quality of life in adults 
      with moderate-to-severe AD while reducing the need for other AD treatments. Video

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Previous trials of dietary interventions to prevent gestational 
      diabetes mellitus (GDM) have yielded only limited success. Low-carbohydrate diets 
      have shown promise for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but there is no evidence 
      to support their use in pregnancy. The aim of this study is to explore the 
      feasibility of a moderately reduced-carbohydrate dietary intervention delivered 
      from mid-pregnancy alongside routine antenatal care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This 
      is a feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) with embedded qualitative 
      study. Sixty women who are pregnant <20 weeks' gestation, with body mass index 
      >/=30 kg/m(2) at their antenatal booking appointment, will be randomised 2:1 
      intervention or control (usual care) and followed up until delivery. The 
      intervention is a moderately reduced-carbohydrate diet (~130-150 g total 
      carbohydrate/day), designed to be delivered alongside routine antenatal 
      appointments. Primary outcomes are measures of adoption of the diet and retention 
      of participants. Secondary outcomes include incidence of GDM, change in markers 
      of glycaemic control, gestational weight gain, total carbohydrate and energy 
      intake. Process outcomes will examine resources and management issues. 
      Exploratory outcomes include further dietary changes, quality of life, maternal 
      and neonatal outcomes, and qualitative measures. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This 
      trial was reviewed and approved by the South-Central Oxford B Research Ethics 
      Committee NHS National Research Ethics Committee and the Health Research 
      Authority (Reference: 20/SC/0442). The study results will inform whether to 
      progress to a full-scale RCT to test the clinical effectiveness of the RECORD 
      programme to prevent GDM in women at high risk. The findings will be published in 
      peer-reviewed journals and presented at conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: 
      ISRCTN16235884.

AB  - Lung cancers with a mutated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are a major 
      contributor to cancer fatalities globally. Targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
      (TKIs) have been developed against EGFR and show encouraging results for survival 
      rate and quality of life. However, drug resistance may affect treatment plans and 
      treatment efficacy may be lost after about a year. Predicting the response to 
      EGFR-TKIs for EGFR-mutated lung cancer patients is a key research area. In this 
      study, we propose a personalized drug response prediction model (PDRP), based on 
      molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning, to predict the response of 
      first generation FDA-approved small molecule EGFR-TKIs, Gefitinib/Erlotinib, in 
      lung cancer patients. The patient's mutation status is taken into consideration 
      in molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Each patient's unique mutation status was 
      modeled considering MD simulation to extract molecular-level geometric features. 
      Moreover, additional clinical features were incorporated into machine learning 
      model for drug response prediction. The complete feature set includes demographic 
      and clinical information (DCI), geometrical properties of the drug-target binding 
      site, and the binding free energy of the drug-target complex from the MD 
      simulation. PDRP incorporates an XGBoost classifier, which achieves 
      state-of-the-art performance with 97.5% accuracy, 93% recall, 96.5% precision, 
      and 94% F1-score, for a 4-class drug response prediction task. We found that 
      modeling the geometry of the binding pocket combined with binding free energy is 
      a good predictor for drug response. However, we observed that clinical 
      information had a little impact on the performance of the model. The proposed 
      model could be tested on other types of cancers. We believe PDRP will support the 
      planning of effective treatment regimes based on clinical-genomic information.

TI  - Management of epilepsy in older adults: A critical review by the ILAE Task Force 
      on Epilepsy in the elderly.
PG  - 567-585
LID - 10.1111/epi.17426 [doi]
AB  - Older adults represent a highly heterogeneous population, with multiple diverse 
      subgroups. Therefore, an individualized approach to treatment is essential to 
      meet the needs of each unique subgroup. Most comparative studies focusing on 
      treatment of epilepsy in older adults have found that levetiracetam has the best 
      chance of long-term seizure freedom. However, there is a lack of studies 
      investigating other newer generation antiseizure medications (ASMs). Although a 
      number of randomized clinical trials have been performed on older adults with 
      epilepsy, the number of participants studied was generally small, and they only 
      investigated short-term efficacy and tolerability. Quality of life as an outcome 
      is often missing but is necessary to understand the effectiveness and possible 
      side effects of treatment. Prognosis needs to move beyond the focus on seizure 
      control to long-term patient-centered outcomes. Dosing studies with newer 
      generation ASMs are needed to understand which treatments are the best in the 
      older adults with different comorbidities. In particular, more high-level 
      evidence is required for older adults with Alzheimer's disease with epilepsy and 
      status epilepticus. Future treatment studies should use greater homogeneity in 
      the inclusion criteria to allow for clearer findings that can be comparable with 
      other studies to build the existing treatment evidence base.

TI  - [Effectiveness of a psychotherapeutic intervention group program in the 
      improvement of caregiver well-being in Alzheimer's disease patients' family 
      caregivers: the CuiDem study].
PG  - 203-211
LID - 10.33588/rn.7508.2022180 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's Disease experience physical 
      and emotional burnout that can be treated with non-pharmacological interventions. 
      AIM: Assess the efficacy of a group cognitive behavioural psychotherapeutic 
      intervention, for improving well-being perception in caregivers, compared to a 
      support group. Also, we assessed its efficacy after a follow-up period of 1-year 
      post-intervention. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A multicentre, open, quasi experimental 
      study with control group was conducted. 221 caregivers of patients with 
      Alzheimer's Disease, with mild to moderate-severe dementia, were non-randomly 
      assigned to either IG-intervention group: psychotherapeutic program without 
      active follow-up period (n = 80); IGF-intervention group: psychotherapeutic 
      program with active follow-up period (n = 78); or CG-control group: support 
      program with active follow-up period (n = 63). The psychotherapeutic intervention 
      (IG and IGF) is a structured cognitive behavioural group program, of one weekly 
      session over four months. The CG had the same duration. Caregiver's burden, mood 
      disorders, resilience, perceived functional social support and quality of life 
      were measured at baseline, post-intervention and after 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: 
      At post-intervention, statistically significant improvements were observed in the 
      IG and IGF compared to CG in caregiver burden (p = 0,0216). After one year 
      follow-up, significant improvements were found in IGF compared to IG in emotional 
      state (p = 0,0271), resilience (p = 0,0018), perceived social support (p = 
      0,014); quality of life (p = 0,0001) and mental health (p = 0,0002); and in CG 
      versus GI in emotional state and social support (p < 0,05). CONCLUSIONS: These 
      results support the efficacy of this psychotherapeutic intervention for improving 
      well-being (burden), and the supportive follow-up period for increasing its 
      efficacy.

TI  - Development and validation of a predictive model to guide the use of plerixafor 
      in pediatric population.
PG  - 1827-1832
LID - 10.1038/s41409-022-01831-2 [doi]
AB  - Plerixafor, a CXCR4 receptor antagonist, reduces the binding and chemotaxis of 
      hematopoietic stem cells to the bone marrow stroma, resulting in predictable peak 
      of cluster of differentiation 34(+) (CD34(+)) cells in the peripheral blood (PB) 
      approximately 10 h after its administration. We developed a model that could 
      predict the CD34(+) harvest volume on the first day of apheresis (AP-CD34(+)) 
      based on PB-CD34(+) counts immediately prior to commencing apheresis in pediatric 
      population. In all, data from 45 pediatric patients from the MOZAIC study who 
      received either granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) alone or G-CSF plus 
      plerixafor were included. The modeling of the data exhibited a strong and highly 
      predictive linear relationship between the counts of PB-CD34(+) cells on the 
      first day of apheresis and AP-CD34(+) cells collected on the same day. It is 
      predicted that there are approximately 13 new collected CD34(+) cells for 100 new 
      circulating CD34(+) cells before apheresis. Our predictive algorithm can be used 
      to quantify the minimal count of PB-CD34(+) cells that enables to collect at 
      least 2 x 10(6) or 5 x 10(6) AP-CD34(+) cells/kg with sufficient assurance 
      (probability = 0.90) and can guide the use of plerixafor in patients at higher 
      perceived risk for mobilization failure. Trial registration of MOZAIC study:

TI  - Melflufen for the treatment of multiple myeloma.
PG  - 371-382
LID - 10.1080/17512433.2022.2075847 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Melphalan flufenamide (melflufen) is a first-in-class peptide-drug 
      conjugate that takes advantage of increased aminopeptidase activity inside tumor 
      cells to rapidly release alkylating agents therein. Melflufen in combination with 
      dexamethasone has been evaluated in multiple clinical trials in patients with 
      relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM). AREAS COVERED: This profile covers the 
      unique mechanism of action of melflufen, the preclinical results supporting its 
      activity in cellular models of resistance to chemotherapy, its activity in animal 
      models of MM, and the clinical pharmacokinetics of melflufen. Findings from 
      clinical trials evaluating melflufen, including the pivotal phase II HORIZON 
      study and the phase III OCEAN study, are discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Although MM 
      treatment has improved, patients with disease refractory to multiple 
      standard-of-care drug classes face a dismal prognosis. Melflufen demonstrated 
      efficacy and tolerability in select populations, with an initial approval in the 
      United States in patients with >/= four previous lines of therapy and 
      triple-class-refractory MM. Results from the phase III OCEAN study - currently 
      under discussion with regulatory agencies in the United States and Europe - are 
      more complex and have been put into context herein. Lastly, melflufen provides a 
      proof-of-concept for the utility of the peptide-drug conjugate platform in 
      relapsed/refractory MM.

TI  - Diagnostic Performance of Generative Adversarial Network-Based Deep Learning 
      Methods for Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Currently, only 
      symptomatic management is available, and early diagnosis and intervention are 
      crucial for AD treatment. As a recent deep learning strategy, generative 
      adversarial networks (GANs) are expected to benefit AD diagnosis, but their 
      performance remains to be verified. This study provided a systematic review on 
      the application of the GAN-based deep learning method in the diagnosis of AD and 
      conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate its diagnostic performance. A search of the 
      following electronic databases was performed by two researchers independently in 
      August 2021: MEDLINE (PubMed), Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science. The 
      Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool was applied 
      to assess the quality of the included studies. The accuracy of the model applied 
      in the diagnosis of AD was determined by calculating odds ratios (ORs) with 95% 
      confidence intervals (CIs). A bivariate random-effects model was used to 
      calculate the pooled sensitivity and specificity with their 95% CIs. Fourteen 
      studies were included, 11 of which were included in the meta-analysis. The 
      overall quality of the included studies was high according to the QUADAS-2 
      assessment. For the AD vs. cognitively normal (CN) classification, the GAN-based 
      deep learning method exhibited better performance than the non-GAN method, with 
      significantly higher accuracy (OR 1.425, 95% CI: 1.150-1.766, P = 0.001), pooled 
      sensitivity (0.88 vs. 0.83), pooled specificity (0.93 vs. 0.89), and area under 
      the curve (AUC) of the summary receiver operating characteristic curve (SROC) 
      (0.96 vs. 0.93). For the progressing MCI (pMCI) vs. stable MCI (sMCI) 
      classification, the GAN method exhibited no significant increase in the accuracy 
      (OR 1.149, 95% CI: 0.878-1.505, P = 0.310) or the pooled sensitivity (0.66 vs. 
      0.66). The pooled specificity and AUC of the SROC in the GAN group were slightly 
      higher than those in the non-GAN group (0.81 vs. 0.78 and 0.81 vs. 0.80, 
      respectively). The present results suggested that the GAN-based deep learning 
      method performed well in the task of AD vs. CN classification. However, the 
      diagnostic performance of GAN in the task of pMCI vs. sMCI classification needs 
      to be improved. Systematic Review Registration: [PROSPERO], Identifier: 
      [CRD42021275294].

TI  - Oxygen-Ozone Therapy for Reducing Pro-Inflammatory Cytokines Serum Levels in 
      Musculoskeletal and Temporomandibular Disorders: A Comprehensive Review.
LID - 10.3390/ijms23052528 [doi]
LID - 2528
AB  - To date, the application of oxygen-ozone (O(2)O(3)) therapy has significantly 
      increased in the common clinical practice in several pathological conditions. 
      However, beyond the favorable clinical effects, the biochemical effects of 
      O(2)O(3) are still far from being understood. This comprehensive review aimed at 
      investigating the state of the art about the effects of O(2)O(3) therapy on 
      pro-inflammatory cytokines serum levels as a modulator of oxidative stress in 
      patients with musculoskeletal and temporomandibular disorders (TMD). The efficacy 
      of O(2)O(3) therapy could be related to the moderate oxidative stress modulation 
      produced by the interaction of ozone with biological components. More in detail, 
      O(2)O(3) therapy is widely used as an adjuvant therapeutic option in several 
      pathological conditions characterized by chronic inflammatory processes and 
      immune overactivation. In this context, most musculoskeletal and 
      temporomandibular disorders (TMD) share these two pathophysiological processes. 
      Despite the paucity of in vivo studies, this comprehensive review suggests that 
      O(2)O(3) therapy might reduce serum levels of interleukin 6 in patients with TMD, 
      low back pain, knee osteoarthritis and rheumatic diseases with a concrete and 
      measurable interaction with the inflammatory pathway. However, to date, further 
      studies are needed to clarify the effects of this promising therapy on 
      inflammatory mediators and their clinical implications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate adverse outcomes and risk 
      factors for the cardiac conduction system in children with perimembranous 
      ventricular septal defects (pmVSDs) who had been treated by catheter 
      intervention. METHOD: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library 
      were searched for studies in English on interventional treatment of pmVSDs in 
      pediatric patients published up to the end of October 15, 2020. We used random- 
      or fixed-effect models to obtain pooled estimates of the success rate and 
      postoperative complications. RESULTS: A total of 1650 pediatric patients from 8 
      publications were included, with a mean age ranging from 3.44 to 8.67 years old. 
      The pooled estimate of successful implantation was 98.2% (95% CI 97.1-99.4%, 
      I(2) = 69.4%; P < 0.001), and the incidence of cardiac conduction system 
      complications was 17.4% (95% CI 8.4-26.4%, I(2) = 96.1%; P < 0.001), among which 
      the incidence of heart block was 14.8% (95% CI 6.4-23.3%, I(2) = 96.9%; 
      P = 0.001). The incidence of impulse formation disorders was 4.1% (95% CI 
      0.7-7.6%, I(2) = 91.7%; P = 0.019), and the incidence of complete 
      atrioventricular block was 0.8% (95% CI 0.3-13%, I(2) = 0.0%; P = 0.001). Risk 
      factors for newly emerging arrhythmias included the VSD size MD = 0.89 (95% CI 
      0.46-1.32, I(2) = 0%; P < 0.0001) and device size MD = 1.26 (95% CI 0.78-1.73, 
      I(2) = 0%; P < 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous catheter intervention is safe 
      and effective in treating pediatric patients with pmVSD, and the risk factors 
      leading to arrhythmias include the sizes of the pmVSD and device.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To analyse the changes in curative care expenditure (CCE) associated 
      with noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) before and after the Beijing healthcare 
      reform, thus providing a reference for the healthcare system. METHODS: A total of 
      60 medical institutions were selected using multistage stratified cluster random 
      sampling in Beijing, China. The records of approximately 100 million outpatients 
      with NCDs in 2016-2018 were extracted. System of Health Accounts 2011 (SHA2011) 
      was used to estimate the CCE. The segmented regression model was established to 
      observe both the instant change and the slope change of intervention in 
      interrupted time series analysis (ITSA). The study was conducted from December 
      2019 to May 2020 in Beijing, China. RESULTS: From SHA2011, we found that the CCE 
      for outpatients with NCDs in Beijing were 58.59, 61.46 and 71.96 billion RMB in 
      2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. The CCE continued to rise at all hospital 
      levels, namely, tertiary, secondary, and community-level hospitals. However, the 
      proportion of CCE in tertiary hospitals decreased. From ITSA, we can also 
      conclude that the CCE showed a significant increasing trend change at the three 
      hospital levels after the intervention. The drug proportion showed a significant 
      decreasing trend change in secondary and tertiary hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Beijing 
      healthcare reform does have an impact on the CCE of NCDs.

AB  - Several recent studies in China have associated raised mortality risks with 
      chronic exposure to ambient PM(2.5). However, cohort evidence covering general 
      populations and more homogeneous regions is extensively scarce. We conceived a 
      nationwide perspective cohort study from 2010 through 2018, by enrolling 30 946 
      adult men and women aged 16-110 years from 25 provincial regions in mainland 
      China. Cox proportional hazards models with time-varying exposures were adopted 
      to quantify longitudinal association of PM(2.5) exposure with all-cause 
      mortality. A total of 1762 death events occurred during a median follow-up of 8.1 
      years. Participants were exposed to a broad range of annual mean PM(2.5) 
      concentrations (2.4-112 mug/m(3)), with an average estimate of 47.5 mug/m(3). A 
      10-mug/m(3) increase in annual average of PM(2.5) exposure was associated with an 
      hazard ratio of 1.055 (95% confidence interval: 1.022-1.088, p < 0.001) for 
      all-cause mortality. We estimated totally 2.68 million deaths attributable to 
      ambient PM(2.5) in 2015, yielding a remarkable reduction of 36.7 thousand 
      compared to the estimate in 2010 (2.72 million deaths). This study added 
      nationally representative evidence regarding concentration-response function for 
      long-term PM(2.5)-mortality association in Chinese adults, which may 
      significantly contribute to national and global assessments of 
      PM(2.5)-attributable death burden.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected more than 96 million people 
      worldwide, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a pandemic in 
      March 2020. Although an optimal medical treatment of COVID-19 remains uncertain, 
      an unprecedented global effort to develop an effective vaccine hopes to restore 
      pre-pandemic conditions. Since cancer patients as a group have been shown to be 
      at a higher risk of severe COVID-19, the development of safe and effective 
      vaccines is crucial. However, cancer patients may be underrepresented in ongoing 
      phase 3 randomised clinical trials investigating COVID-19 vaccines. Therefore, we 
      encourage stakeholders to provide real-time data about the characteristics of 
      recruited participants, including clearly identifiable subgroups, like cancer 
      patients, with sample sizes large enough to determine safety and efficacy. 
      Moreover, we envisage a prompt implementation of suitable registries for 
      pharmacovigilance reporting, in order to monitor the effects of COVID-19 vaccines 
      and immunisation rates in patients with cancer. That said, data extrapolation 
      from other vaccine trials (e.g. anti-influenza virus) showed a favourable safety 
      and efficacy profile for cancer patients. On the basis of the evidence discussed, 
      we believe that the benefits of the vaccination outweigh the risks. Consequently, 
      healthcare authorities should prioritise vaccinations for cancer patients, with 
      the time-point of administration agreed on a case-by-case basis. In this regard, 
      the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the European Society of Medical 
      Oncology are advocating for cancer patients a high priority status, in the hope 
      of attenuating the consequences of the pandemic in this particularly vulnerable 
      population.

TI  - Severe infections in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis treated with 
      rituximab.
PG  - 205-212
LID - 10.1093/rheumatology/keab293 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Rituximab (RTX) is an anti-CD20 antibody that selectively depletes B 
      cells and has emerged as a therapy for ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) during 
      the past decade. This study sought to quantify and determine potential risk 
      factors for severe infections in AAV patients treated with RTX at rheumatology 
      clinics in Mexico City, Mexico and Lund, Sweden. METHODS: The study consisted of 
      a retrospective case-record review (2005-15) with standardized data collection 
      related to the occurrence of severe infection in 46 patients with AAV in Mexico 
      City (n = 20) and Lund (n = 26) treated with RTX during their disease course. 
      Median duration of follow-up from first RTX dose to death or end of study was 
      26 months. RESULTS: Eleven (24%) patients suffered a total of 18 severe 
      infections (infection rate of 11.5/100 patient-years). Thirteen of the 18 
      infections (72%) occurred within the first year of treatment. Risk factors for 
      severe infection were older age at RTX initiation and absence of ENT involvement 
      at diagnosis. In multivariate analyses, age at RTX infusion was the only 
      independent factor predicting severe infection. Four patients (9%) died during 
      follow-up, all as a result of infection. CONCLUSION: Severe infections are common 
      following RTX treatment, and mortality due to infection is a major concern. Most 
      severe infections occur within the first year of RTX treatment. The negative 
      correlation of ENT involvement with severe infection might reflect granulomatosis 
      with polyangiitis phenotype heterogeneity. Older age at time of RTX treatment 
      independently predicts severe infections.

TI  - Optimal treatments for TAFRO syndrome: a retrospective surveillance study in 
      Japan.
PG  - 73-80
LID - 10.1007/s12185-020-03008-3 [doi]
AB  - TAFRO syndrome is a systemic inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology 
      characterized by thrombocytopenia, anasarca, fever, reticulin myelofibrosis, 
      renal dysfunction, and organomegaly. Mortality in patients with this syndrome is 
      high; however, an optimal treatment strategy has not been established. To explore 
      the strategy, we retrospectively analyzed 81 patients with TAFRO syndrome 
      registered in the Multicenter Collaborative Retrospective Study for Establishing 
      the Concept of TAFRO Syndrome in Japan by December 2019. Sixty-eight patients 
      received corticosteroid therapy as the first-line treatment, and as the 
      second-line treatment, 21 received tocilizumab (Toc), 14 received cyclosporine A 
      (CsA), and 8 received rituximab (Rit) in addition to corticosteroids. We compared 
      these second-line treatment groups by setting the primary endpoint as time to 
      next treatment or death (TTNT). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the median TTNT 
      in the Toc, CsA, and Rit groups were 2.8 months, 9.2 months, and not reached, 
      respectively. The TTNT of the Rit group was significantly longer than that of the 
      Toc group. In contrast, there were no significant differences in overall survival 
      between groups, indicating that subsequent salvage therapies rescued a large 
      proportion of patients who failed the second-line treatments. Further studies are 
      warranted to establish the optimal treatment strategies for this syndrome.

AB  - According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of today, there are 
      2.165.500 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and 145.705 
      deaths in over 185 countries. Unfortunately, despite the tremendous efforts to 
      develop a vaccine initiated by various leading health institutions all over the 
      world, it may be 18 months before a vaccine against the coronavirus is publicly 
      available. We are proposing a theory about testing the use of the Bordetella 
      pertussis vaccine to protect against COVID-19. We deliver this theory to the 
      scientific community, aiming to raise the concern about it, and to provide us 
      with support by realistic and experimental evidence.

TI  - Intercostal to musculocutaneous nerve transfer in patients with complete 
      traumatic brachial plexus injuries: case series.
PG  - 1907-1912
LID - 10.1007/s00701-020-04433-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To recover biceps strength in patients with complete brachial plexus 
      injuries, the intercostal nerve can be transferred to the musculocutaneous nerve. 
      The surgical results are very controversial, and most of the studies with good 
      outcomes and large samples were carried out in Asiatic countries. The objective 
      of the study was to evaluate biceps strength after intercostal nerve transfer in 
      patients undergoing this procedure in a Western country hospital. METHODS: We 
      retrospectively analyzed 39 patients from 2011 to 2016 with traumatic brachial 
      plexus injuries receiving intercostal to musculocutaneous nerve transfer in a 
      rehabilitation hospital. The biceps strength was graded using the British Medical 
      Research Council (BMRC) scale. The variables reported and analyzed were age, the 
      time between trauma and surgery, surgeon experience, body mass index, nerve 
      receptor (biceps motor branch or musculocutaneous nerve), and the number of 
      intercostal nerves transferred. Statistical tests, with a significance level of 
      5%, were used. RESULTS: Biceps strength recovery was graded >/=M3 in 19 patients 
      (48.8%) and M4 in 15 patients (38.5%). There was no statistical association 
      between biceps strength and the variables. The most frequent complication was a 
      pleural rupture. CONCLUSIONS: Intercostal to musculocutaneous nerve transfer is a 
      safe procedure. Still, biceps strength after surgery was >/=M3 in only 48.8% of the 
      patients. Other donor nerve options should be considered, e.g., the phrenic or 
      spinal accessory nerves.

TI  - Mendelian Randomization of Circulating Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids and Colorectal 
      Cancer Risk.
PG  - 860-870
LID - 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-19-0891 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Results from epidemiologic studies examining polyunsaturated fatty 
      acids (PUFA) and colorectal cancer risk are inconsistent. Mendelian randomization 
      may strengthen causal inference from observational studies. Given their shared 
      metabolic pathway, examining the combined effects of aspirin/NSAID use with PUFAs 
      could help elucidate an association between PUFAs and colorectal cancer risk. 
      METHODS: Information was leveraged from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) 
      regarding PUFA-associated SNPs to create weighted genetic scores (wGS) 
      representing genetically predicted circulating blood PUFAs for 11,016 
      non-Hispanic white colorectal cancer cases and 13,732 controls in the Genetics 
      and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO). Associations per SD 
      increase in the wGS were estimated using unconditional logistic regression. 
      Interactions between PUFA wGSs and aspirin/NSAID use on colorectal cancer risk 
      were also examined. RESULTS: Modest colorectal cancer risk reductions were 
      observed per SD increase in circulating linoleic acid [OR(LA) = 0.96; 95% 
      confidence interval (CI) = 0.93-0.98; P = 5.2 x 10(-4)] and alpha-linolenic acid 
      (OR(ALA) = 0.95; 95% CI = 0.92-0.97; P = 5.4 x 10(-5)), whereas modest increased 
      risks were observed for arachidonic (OR(AA) = 1.06; 95% CI = 1.03-1.08; P = 3.3 x 
      10(-5)), eicosapentaenoic (OR(EPA) = 1.04; 95% CI = 1.01-1.07; P = 2.5 x 10(-3)), 
      and docosapentaenoic acids (OR(DPA) = 1.03; 95% CI = 1.01-1.06; P = 1.2 x 
      10(-2)). Each of these effects was stronger among aspirin/NSAID nonusers in the 
      stratified analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that higher circulating 
      shorter-chain PUFAs (i.e., LA and ALA) were associated with reduced colorectal 
      cancer risk, whereas longer-chain PUFAs (i.e., AA, EPA, and DPA) were associated 
      with an increased colorectal cancer risk. IMPACT: The interaction of PUFAs with 
      aspirin/NSAID use indicates a shared colorectal cancer inflammatory pathway. 
      Future research should continue to improve PUFA genetic instruments to elucidate 
      the independent effects of PUFAs on colorectal cancer.

AB  - With the alarming burden of antibiotic resistance, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) 
      seem to be novel antimicrobial alternatives for infection treatment due to their 
      rapid broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and low tendency for bacterial 
      resistance. To obtain promising AMPs, a series of new peptides were designed and 
      synthesized by conjugating various lengths of fatty acid chains onto the side 
      chain of the position 4 or 7 D-amino acid of Ano-D4,7 (analogue of anoplin with 
      D-amino acid substitutions at positions 4 and 7). The new peptides exhibited 
      excellent antimicrobial activity against a range of bacteria, especially 
      multidrug-resistant bacteria in contrast to conventional antibiotics. Moreover, 
      the new peptides conjugated with fatty acid chains ranging from 8 to 12 carbons 
      in length presented preferable antimicrobial selectivity and anti-biofilm 
      activity. Additionally, the new peptides also exerted high stability to trypsin, 
      serum, salts and different pH environments. Most notably, the new peptides showed 
      a low tendency to develop bacterial resistance and they displayed optimal 
      antimicrobial activity against the obtained resistant strains. Furthermore, the 
      results from the outer/inner membrane permeabilization and cytoplasmic membrane 
      depolarization assays and flow cytometry and scanning electron microscopy 
      analyses demonstrated that the new peptides exert antimicrobial effects by 
      typical non-receptor-mediated membrane mechanisms, as well as intracellular 
      targets characterized by gel retardation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
      generation assays. Furthermore, the new peptides presented remarkable in vivo 
      antimicrobial potency, anti-inflammatory activity, and endotoxin neutralization. 
      Collectively, the conjugation of fatty acids to the side chains of D-amino acids 
      is a potential strategy for designing hopeful antimicrobial alternatives to 
      tackle the risk of bacterial resistance.

TI  - Perioperative adverse events attributed to alpha2-adrenoceptor agonists in patients 
      not at risk of cardiovascular events: systematic review and meta-analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several systematic reviews have reported the benefits of 
      perioperative alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist use for various conditions, but safety 
      evidence is poorly documented. METHODS: We performed a systematic review focusing 
      on adverse events. We searched the MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Cochrane, and 
      Clinical Trials Register databases for RCTs comparing the effects of 
      alpha2-adrenoceptor agonists and placebo during non-cardiovascular surgery under 
      general anaesthesia, for any indication, in patients not at risk of 
      cardiovascular events. The primary outcome was the incidence of severe adverse 
      events during or after alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist administration. The secondary 
      endpoints were other adverse events. A meta-analysis was carried out on the 
      combined data. Evidence quality was rated by the Grading of Recommendations 
      Assessment, Development and Evaluation method. RESULTS: We included 56 studies 
      (4868 patients). Our review, based on moderate-quality evidence, revealed that 
      hypotension occurred frequently during the preoperative and postoperative 
      periods, for both clonidine and dexmedetomidine. Bradycardia was reported only 
      with dexmedetomidine. In contrast, dexmedetomidine seemed to protect against 
      intraoperative hypertension and tachycardia. Subgroup analysis suggested that the 
      risk of hypotension and bradycardia persisted after cessation of treatment. 
      Interestingly, intraoperative hypotension and postoperative bradycardia were not 
      observed with a bolus dosage of dexmedetomidine less than 0.5 mug kg(-1) or with 
      continuous administration alone. CONCLUSIONS: Pooled data for the incidence of 
      adverse events associated with use of alpha2-adrenoceptor agonists in various 
      perioperative contexts provide high-confidence evidence for a risk of hypotension 
      and bradycardia, and protective effects against hypertension and tachycardia.

AB  - Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is the most common complication of shingles caused 
      by reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV). Management of PHN is often 
      suboptimal while using current conventional treatments. Antiviral therapy was 
      used to reduce PHN-associated pain in two small trials which showed conflicting 
      results. We hypothesize the analgesic efficacy of antiviral therapy on PHN is 
      affected by patient characteristics including pathophysiology of the participants 
      and serum vitamin D levels. Pathophysiology of PHN includes neuronal excitability 
      and chronic VZV ganglionitis (persistent active VZV infection in ganglions). 
      VZV-DNA positivity or a positive IgG coupled with a positive IgM indicates recent 
      or current VZV infection. Positive VZV-DNA or IgG/IgM tests are used to confirm 
      whether the patients experience chronic VZV ganglionitis. Antiviral therapy 
      decreases pain in PHN patients with chronic VZV ganglionitis; whereas, antiviral 
      therapy shows no effects in PHN patients with negative VZV-DNA or IgM. Vitamin D 
      is a natural antiviral mediator. Studies show a high prevalence of vitamin D 
      deficiency in hepatitis B/C virus-infected patients. Serum vitamin D levels and 
      vitamin D supplementation are factors which affect the antiviral efficacy on 
      hepatitis B/C virus infection. Serum 25-OHD levels of hospitalized patients with 
      shingles were significantly lower compared to healthy controls. Accordingly, PHN 
      patient may have a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency which negatively 
      affects the antiviral efficacy. Vitamin D supplementation may improve the 
      antiviral efficacy on PHN. Future trials regarding antiviral therapy on PHN 
      should consider patient characteristics and should be conducted among different 
      subgroups of PHN patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Folic acid (FA) supplementation is known to prevent neural tube 
      defects (NTDs). We examined whether this preventive effect differs by the sex of 
      the infant. METHODS: Data were gathered from a large population-based cohort 
      study in China that evaluated the effects of FA supplementation on NTDs. All 
      births at 20 complete gestational weeks, including live births, stillbirths, and 
      pregnancy terminations, and all NTDs, regardless of gestational age, were 
      recorded. In a northern China province, a total of 30,801 singleton live births 
      to women whose use of FA supplements during the first trimester was known at the 
      time were included in the study. The birth prevalence of NTDs was classified by 
      sex, subtype, and maternal FA supplementation. Male to female rate ratios [RR] 
      and their 95% confidence intervals [CI] were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 106 
      NTDs cases were recorded. The overall prevalence of NTDs was 2.5 per thousand among males and 
      4.4 per thousand among females; NTDs were less prevalent among males than among females (RR, 
      0.58; 95% CI, 0.54-0.63). There was a higher prevalence of anencephaly (RR, 0.34; 
      95% CI, 0.27-0.43) and spina bifida (RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.63-0.84) among females. 
      However, FA supplementation led to significantly greater decreases in the rates 
      of anencephaly (4.8 per thousand) and total NTDs (7.6 per thousand) in females than in males (1.6 per thousand and 
      2.8 per thousand, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: FA supplementation successfully reduces the 
      prevalence of NTDs in both male and female infants, although we found a 
      significantly greater decrease in anencephaly and total NTDs in females than in 
      males. How the protective effects of FA supplementation affect the sexes 
      differently needs to be studied further.

TI  - Intra-Arterial TheraSphere Yttrium-90 Glass Microspheres in the Treatment of 
      Patients With Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Protocol for the STOP-HCC 
      Phase 3 Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - e11234

AB  - BACKGROUND: Globally, hepatocellular carcinoma is the second most common cause of 
      cancer deaths. It remains challenging to intensify cancer treatment without 
      impairing liver function. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the TheraSphere in the 
      Treatment of Patients with Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma (STOP-HCC) study 
      is to examine the hypothesis that transarterial radioembolization (TheraSphere 
      yttrium-90 glass microspheres) combined with standard first-line treatment with 
      sorafenib will improve outcomes over treatment with sorafenib alone in 
      unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. The STOP-HCC study is the largest 
      international, multicenter, prospective study of intra-arterial treatment in 
      combination with sorafenib in unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Here we 
      report the study design. METHODS: STOP-HCC is a prospective, phase 3, open-label, 
      randomized controlled study conducted across up to 105 sites in North America, 
      Europe, and Asia. Eligible adults have unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and 
      a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks, 1 or more unidimensional measurable 
      lesions, Child-Pugh score 7 points or less, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
      Group Performance Status score 1 or lower, and are candidates for treatment with 
      sorafenib. Presence of branch portal vein tumor thrombosis is permitted. Patients 
      were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either sorafenib alone or 
      transarterial radioembolization followed by sorafenib within 2 to 6 weeks. The 
      primary outcome is overall survival. Secondary outcomes are time to progression, 
      time to untreatable progression, time to symptomatic progression, tumor response, 
      quality of life, and adverse event occurrence. The study is an adaptive trial, 
      comprising a group-sequential design with 2 interim analyses with 520 patients, 
      and an option to increase the sample size to 700 patients at the second interim 
      analysis. The sample size of 520 patients allows for 417 deaths to give 80% power 
      to detect an increase in median overall survival from 10.7 months for the 
      sorafenib group (based on the Sorafenib Hepatocellular Carcinoma Assessment 
      Randomized Protocol [SHARP] trial) to 14.2 months for the transarterial 
      radioembolization+sorafenib group (hazard ratio 0.754) with 2-sided alpha of .05. 
      The increased sample size of 700 patients allows for 564 deaths to give 80% power 
      to detect a smaller difference in median overall survival from 10.7 months for 
      the sorafenib group to 13.7 months for the transarterial 
      radioembolization+sorafenib group (hazard ratio 0.781). RESULTS: Enrollment for 
      the study completed in September 2017. Results of the first and second interim 
      analyses were reviewed by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee. The 
      recommendation of the committee, at both interim analyses, was to continue the 
      study without any changes. CONCLUSIONS: The STOP-HCC study will contribute toward 
      the establishment of the role of combination therapy with transarterial 
      radioembolization and sorafenib in the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular 
      carcinoma with and without branch portal vein tumor thrombosis. TRIAL

TI  - Oncological and peri-surgical outcomes of radical prostatectomy for 
      non-metastatic prostate cancer with prostate-specific antigen level of 50 ng/ml 
      or greater.
PG  - 485-490
LID - 10.1093/jjco/hyy044 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of radical prostatectomy in treating non-metastatic prostate 
      cancer patients with high prostate-specific antigen levels remains unclear. We 
      evaluated the feasibility and oncological outcomes of radical prostatectomy in 
      non-metastatic prostate cancer patients with prostate-specific antigen levels of 
      50 ng/ml or higher. METHODS: This retrospective study included 31 patients who 
      were diagnosed as very high-risk prostate cancer (clinical stage of any T, N0-1 
      M0 and PSA levels >/=50 ng/ml) and underwent radical prostatectomy either as a 
      monotherapy or as a component of multimodal therapy (RP group). Surgery-related 
      complications were investigated. Time to castration-resistant prostate cancer, 
      cancer-specific survival, and overall survival were estimated using the 
      Kaplan-Meier method. A total of 47 patients with very high-risk prostate cancer 
      who were treated with androgen deprivation therapy without local therapy served 
      as a control group (ADT group). Survivals were compared between RP group and ADT 
      group in exploratory analyses. RESULTS: The median pretreatment prostate-specific 
      antigen was 87 ng/ml and 100 ng/ml in the RP and ADT groups, respectively (P = 
      0.67). Surgical complications of Clavien-Dindo Grade 3 were documented in nine 
      patients (29%). Ten-year castration-resistant prostate cancer-free, 
      cancer-specific and overall survivals were 78%, 81% and 77% in RP group, 
      respectively, and they were significantly better than those of ADT group (54%, P 
      = 0.006; 54%, P = 0.006 and 38%, P < 0.001). Exploratory multivariate analysis 
      identified radical prostatectomy as the only significant factor associated with a 
      better cancer-specific survival (hazard ratio: 0.25, P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Radical prostatectomy is feasible for non-metastatic prostate cancer patients 
      with prostate-specific antigen levels of 50 ng/ml or higher. Radical 
      prostatectomy is a viable option for select patients with non-metastatic, very 
      high-risk prostate cancer.

TI  - Lean Mass Appears to Be More Strongly Associated with Bone Health than Fat Mass 
      in Urban Black South African Women.
PG  - 628-36

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between body composition (fat mass, lean 
      mass and body mass index, BMI) and bone health (bone mineral density, BMD and 
      fracture risk) in urban black South African women. DESIGN: A cross sectional 
      study examining associations between body composition, dietary intake (food 
      frequency questionnaire), habitual physical activity (Activity energy expenditure 
      (AEE) measured using an accelerometer with combined heart rate monitor and 
      physical activity questionnaire) and bone health (BMD using dual-energy X ray 
      absorptiometry, DXA and fracture risk). SETTING: Urban community dwellers from 
      Ikageng in the North-West Province of South Africa. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and 
      eighty nine (189) healthy postmenopausal women aged >/=43 years. RESULTS: Fat mass 
      and lean mass were significantly associated with BMD and fracture risk when 
      adjusted for potential confounders. However, lean mass and not fat mass remained 
      significantly associated with femoral neck BMD (beta = 0.49, p <0.001), spine BMD (beta 
      = 0.48, p< 0.0001) and hip BMD (beta = 0.59, p< 0.0001). Lean mass was also 
      negatively associated with fracture risk (beta = -0.19 p =0.04) when both lean and 
      fat mass were in the same model. CONCLUSION: Lean mass and fat mass were 
      positively associated with femoral neck, spine and hip BMDs and negatively 
      associated with fracture risk in urban black South African women. Our finding 
      suggests that increasing lean mass rather than fat mass is beneficial to bone 
      health. Our study emphasises the importance of positive lifestyle changes, intake 
      of calcium from dairy and adequate weight to maintain and improve bone health of 
      postmenopausal women.

AB  - Advancement of bone tissue engineering as an alternative for bone regeneration 
      has attracted significant interest due to its potential in reducing the costs and 
      surgical trauma affiliated with the effective treatment of bone defects. We have 
      improved the conventional approach of producing polymeric nanoparticles, as one 
      of the most promising choices for drug delivery systems, using a microfluidics 
      platform, thus further improving our control over osteogenic differentiation of 
      mesenchymal stem cells. Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for 
      theoretical understanding of our experiments in order to get a more detailed 
      molecular-scale insight into the drug-carrier interactions. In this work, with 
      the sustained intracellular delivery of dexamethasone from 
      microfluidics-synthesized nanoparticles, we explored the effects of particle 
      design on controlling stem cell fates. We believe that the insights learned from 
      this work will lead to the discovery of new strategies to tune differentiation 
      for in situ differentiation or stem cell therapeutics. FROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR: 
      The use of mesenchymal stem cells has been described by many researchers as a 
      novel therapy for bone regeneration. One major hurdle in this approach is the 
      control of osteogenic differentiation. In this article, the authors described 
      elegantly their microfluidic system in which dexamethasone loaded nanoparticles 
      were produced. This system would allow precise fabrication of nanoparticles and 
      consequently higher efficiency in cellular differentiation.

PG  - 241-5
LID - 10.1007/s00701-014-2309-0 [doi]
AB  - Subependymal giant cell tumor (SGCT) is a benign intraventricular tumor, usually 
      located near the foramen of Monro. It is almost always associated with tuberous 
      sclerosis complex (TSC). SGCTs may obstruct cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathways. 
      Rarely, they may secrete a protein-rich exudate, causing communicating 
      hydrocephalus. Surgery is indicated for symptomatic lesions or growing 
      asymptomatic lesions. The operative approach to SGCT has shifted from simple 
      shunt placement to a more aggressive approach, leading to early attempts at gross 
      total resection. Recently, the mTOR inhibitor everolimus has been approved for 
      treating SGCT. In this article, we present two cases of recurrent shunt 
      malfunctions in adult TSC patients with protein-secreting SGCTs. We describe the 
      complexity of treating such patients with an emphasis on the role mTOR inhibitors 
      may have in their management. We also review the literature on surgical 
      management of SGCT-related hydrocephalus.

AB  - The freshwater crab Sinopotamon henanense was exposed to Cd and Zn either on 
      their own or in combination. At 14 and 28 days the hepatopancreas was taken and 
      total metal and metallothionein MT) in transcript abundance were assessed. In 
      addition, the subcellular contents of Cd and Zn also were examined following a 
      differential centrifugation. The results showed that concentration of Cd was more 
      responsive to waterborne metal exposures than the concentration of Zn; Zn was 
      better regulated and exhibited only 2-3 fold increases relative to the control. 
      Of the subcellular fractions, the heat stable protein (HSP) fraction was the 
      predominant metal-binding compartment for Cd. The proportion and accumulation of 
      Cd in this fraction increased with the single Cd exposures, which suggest that 
      metallothionein-like proteins play a key role in metal detoxification in the 
      hepatopancreas of S. henanense. Despite the increases in Cd in the HSP fraction 
      during single Cd exposures, some accumulation of Cd was observed in metal 
      sensitive fraction (MSF), which showed that metal detoxification was incomplete. 
      The results demonstrated that the Cd content decreased in metal mixture groups 
      especially when mixed with higher Zn, while the Cd accumulation in MSF was also 
      reduced when Zn was added. MT mRNA expression was also determined in our report, 
      the results showed that both Cd and Zn had the ability of inducing MT mRNA 
      expression. Additionally, the MT mRNA transcription level was enhanced when Cd 
      was mixed with Zn.

TI  - Hematologic changes during prostate cancer radiation therapy are dependent on the 
      treatment volume.
PG  - 835-43
LID - 10.2217/fon.13.237 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To assess hematologic changes of modern prostate radiation therapy (RT) 
      comparing different target volumes. PATIENTS & METHODS: Blood samples were 
      evaluated before (T1), during (T2-T4) and 6-8 weeks after (T5) RT in a group of 
      113 patients. Whole-pelvic RT up to 46 Gy was applied in 27 cases. The total dose 
      to the prostatic fossa (n = 46)/prostate (n = 67) was 66/76 Gy. RESULTS: 
      Erythrocyte, leukocyte and platelet levels decreased significantly relative to 
      baseline levels at T2-T5. Neoadjuvant hormonal therapy had an impact on 
      hemoglobin levels before and during RT. The cumulative incidence of grade 2 
      leukopenia was 15 versus 2% (p = 0.02) and grade 2 anemia 8 versus 0% (p = 0.03) 
      with versus without whole-pelvic RT, respectively. Lymphocyte decrease was larger 
      at times T2-T5 (36 vs 3% grade 3 toxicity; p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Prostate RT has 
      a small but significant and longer effect on the blood count. Lower lymphocyte 
      levels need to be considered when larger volumes are treated.

TI  - Severe infusion reactions to cetuximab occur within 1 h in patients with 
      metastatic colorectal cancer: results of a nationwide, multicenter, prospective 
      registry study of 2126 patients in Japan.
PG  - 541-6
LID - 10.1093/jjco/hyu049 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Infusion reactions are common adverse reactions associated with 
      antibody preparations. However, no studies have examined the time to onset of 
      serious infusion reactions after administering cetuximab. We aimed to investigate 
      the timing and severity of IRs affecting Japanese patients after administration 
      of cetuximab. METHODS: Study subjects were identified from a nationwide 
      prospective registry of 2126 metastatic colorectal cancer patients scheduled to 
      receive cetuximab. Infusion reactions were examined in 2006 patients with 
      adequate safety data. RESULTS: Infusion reactions of any grade occurred in 114 
      patients (5.7%), including Grade 3-4 infusion reactions in 22 patients (1.1%). 
      Premedications were antihistamine plus corticosteroid (88.9% of patients with 
      infusion reactions), antihistamine alone (9.2%) or corticosteroid alone (1.1%). 
      In 95 patients (83.3%), infusion reactions occurred after the first dose. Twenty 
      of the 22 Grade 3-4 infusion reactions occurred within 1 h of the first dose (the 
      timing of the infusion reaction was unknown in one patient while another infusion 
      reaction occurred after the fourth dose). Infusion reactions resolved in 111/114 
      patients (97.4%) while one patient recovered with sequelae, one patient died and 
      one patient failed to recover within the follow-up period. Thirteen patients 
      (15.7% of patients with infusion reactions) with Grade 1-2 infusion reactions 
      showed recurrence after readministration of cetuximab; the recurrent infusion 
      reactions were less severe than the initial reactions. CONCLUSIONS: Grade 3-4 
      infusion reactions occurred in 1.1% of colorectal cancer patients, and most 
      occurred within 1 h of receiving the first dose of cetuximab. Therefore, patients 
      should be carefully observed following cetuximab infusion, especially during the 
      first hour after the first infusion.

TI  - Cortisol increases CXCR4 expression but does not affect CD62L and CCR7 levels on 
      specific T cell subsets in humans.
PG  - E1322-9
LID - 10.1152/ajpendo.00678.2013 [doi]
AB  - Glucocorticoids are well known to affect T cell migration, leading to a 
      redistribution of the cells from blood to the bone marrow, accompanied by a 
      concurrent suppression of lymph node homing. Despite numerous studies in this 
      context, with most of them employing synthetic glucocorticoids in 
      nonphysiological doses, the mechanisms of this redistribution are not well 
      understood. Here, we investigated in healthy men the impact of cortisol at 
      physiological concentrations on the expression of different migration molecules 
      on eight T cell subpopulations in vivo and in vitro. Hydrocortisone (cortisol, 22 
      mg) infused during nocturnal rest when endogenous cortisol levels are low, 
      compared with placebo, differentially reduced numbers of T cell subsets, with 
      naive CD4(+) and CD8(+) subsets exhibiting the strongest reduction. 
      Hydrocortisone in vivo and in vitro increased CXCR4 expression, which presumably 
      mediates the recruitment of T cells to the bone marrow. Expression of the lymph 
      node homing receptor CD62L on total CD3(+) and CD8(+) T cells appeared reduced 
      following hydrocortisone infusion. However, this was due to a selective 
      extravasation of CD62L(+) T cell subsets, as hydrocortisone affected neither 
      CD62L expression on a subpopulation level nor CD62L expression in vitro. 
      Corresponding results in the opposite direction were observed after blocking of 
      endogenous cortisol synthesis by metyrapone. CCR7, another lymph node homing 
      receptor, was also unaffected by hydrocortisone in vitro. Thus, cortisol seems to 
      redirect T cells to the bone marrow by upregulating their CXCR4 expression, 
      whereas its inhibiting effect on T cell homing to lymph nodes is apparently 
      regulated independently of the expression of classical homing receptors.

AB  - Background. As distress in society increases, including work environments, 
      individual capacities to compete with stress have to be strengthened. Objective. 
      We examined the impact of a web-based happiness training on psychological and 
      physiological parameters, by self-report and objective means, in an occupational 
      health setting. Methods. Randomized controlled trial with 147 employees. 
      Participants were divided into intervention (happiness training) and control 
      groups (waiting list). The intervention consisted of a seven-week online 
      training. Questionnaires were administered before, after, and four weeks after 
      training. The following scales were included: VAS (happiness and satisfaction), 
      WHO-5 Well-being Index, Stress Warning Signals, Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory, 
      Recovery Experience Questionnaire, and Flourishing Scale. Subgroup samples for 
      saliva cortisol and alpha-amylase determinations were taken, indicating stress, 
      and Attention Network Testing for effects on attention regulation. Results. 
      Happiness (P = 0.000; d = 0.93), satisfaction (P = 0.000; d = 1.17), and quality 
      of life (P = 0.000; d = 1.06) improved; perceived stress was reduced (P = 0.003; 
      d = 0.64); mindfulness (P = 0.006; d = 0.62), flourishing (P = 0.002; d = 0.63), 
      and recovery experience (P = 0.030; d = 0.42) also increased significantly. No 
      significant differences in the Attention Network Tests and saliva results 
      occurred (intergroup), except for one saliva value. Conclusions. The web-based 
      training can be a useful tool for stabilizing health/psychological well-being and 
      work/life balance.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine effects of enneagram group 
      counseling program on self-identification and depression in nursing college 
      students. Three groups, categorized by how the students solve their conflicts, 
      were selected to identify changes from the program. METHODS: A quasi-experimental 
      study with a non-equivalent control group and pre posttest design was used. 
      Participants were assigned to the experimental group (n=30) or control group 
      (n=33). The experimental group participated in enneagram group counseling program 
      for 38 hours through eight sessions covering four different topics. Collected 
      data were analyzed using Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, t-test, and 
      Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS: Total self-identity score for the 
      experimental group was significantly higher than the control group. However, 
      there was no significant difference between the two groups for depression scores. 
      The Assertive and Compliant groups demonstrated significant change in 
      self-identification while the Withdrawn groups did not reveal any change. 
      CONCLUSION: Results indicate that the enneagram group counseling program is very 
      effective in establishing positive self-identification for nursing college 
      students who face developmental crisis and stressful situations. It is also 
      expected that this program would be useful to enhance the students' confidence 
      through a deeper understanding and acceptance of themselves.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the introduction of a device, 
      resulting from the combination of an o'ring attachment with an orthodontic 
      implant (o'ring ortho implant, O'ROI), to affix the surgical template of 
      CAD/CAM-guided implant surgery contribute to minimizing the deviations in the 
      position and inclination of implants at the time of their placement. Ten models 
      simulating bone tissue were fabricated and randomly divided into 2 groups: 5 with 
      the scanning and surgical template of the usual technique, representing the 
      Control Group (C), and 5 with scanning and surgical templates fixed by o'ring 
      ortho implants (O'ROI), representing the Test Group (T). Forty implants measuring 
      4x11 mm were placed in the groups, using the respective templates. The results 
      were evaluated by the fusion of CT images of the planned and placed implants. The 
      locations and axes were compared. There were no statistically significant 
      differences for the angular (Tukey's test F = 1.06 and p = 0. 3124) and linear 
      (ANOVA F = 2.54 and p = 0.11) deviations. However, the angular values of Group T 
      showed a lower standard deviation in comparison with those of Group C. The use of 
      o'ring ortho implants (O'ROI) is able to minimize the angular and linear 
      deviation of implants at the time of their placement.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The increased number of patients undergoing transplantation has 
      increased the number of transplant recipients undergoing total hip replacement 
      arthroplasty (THRA). We have evaluated the association between transplantation 
      and acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients undergoing THRA. METHODS: Patients who 
      underwent THRA from May 2004 to February 2012 were retrospectively assessed. 
      Their demographic and clinical characteristics, the results of perioperative 
      laboratory tests, the amounts of fluids transfused during surgery, and anesthesia 
      time were evaluated. Patients were divided into 2 groups: transplant (n = 222) 
      and nontransplant (n = 2,044) patients. With use of the maximal Acute Kidney 
      Injury Network criteria, AKI was evaluated by changes in creatinine concentration 
      within 48 hours of THRA. Propensity analyses and logistic regression were 
      performed to evaluate the association between transplantation and postoperative 
      AKI. RESULTS: Postoperative AKI was significantly associated with transplantation 
      (P < .0001), and transplantation was an independent factor predictive of 
      postoperative AKI (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Transplant recipients are at risk for 
      AKI following THRA. The mechanism by which organ transplantation enhances 
      postoperative AKI warrants further evaluation.

TI  - Pigmentary characteristics, UV radiation exposure, and risk of non-Hodgkin 
      lymphoma: a prospective study among Scandinavian women.
PG  - 1569-76
LID - 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-10-0115 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: UV radiation and pigmentary characteristics may be associated with 
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) risk, but few prospective studies exist. We 
      investigated these associations in a Norwegian-Swedish cohort. METHODS: The 
      cohort included women ages 30 to 50 years at enrolment in 1991 to 1992. Host 
      factors, and exposure to sun and artificial tanning devices in life-decades 0 to 
      50 years were collected by questionnaire. Relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence 
      intervals (CI) were estimated by Poisson regression. RESULTS: Among 104,953 women 
      with complete follow-up through 2006 (Sweden) and 2007 (Norway), 158 were 
      diagnosed with NHL. Women with brown hair had an increased risk of NHL compared 
      with dark brown-haired/black-haired women (RR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.08-2.74); 
      decreased risks were found among women with gray, green or mixed (RR, 0.50; 95% 
      CI, 0.32-0.77), or blue (RR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.35-0.81) eyes compared with those 
      with brown eyes, and among those with high propensity to burn compared with those 
      with low propensity (RR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.36-0.91). Annual number of sunburns and 
      bathing vacations in any age decade, or ever use of artificial tanning devices 
      were not significantly associated with NHL risk. After exposure at ages 10 to 39 
      years, RRs for ever versus never exposed were 0.99 (95% CI, 0.65-1.50) for 
      sunburn, 1.00 (95% CI, 0.64-1.54) for bathing vacations, and 0.99 (95% CI, 
      0.67-1.46) for artificial tanning device use. CONCLUSION: Whereas several 
      pigmentary characteristics were associated with NHL risk, our results do not 
      support an association between UV radiation and NHL. IMPACT: Studies of UV 
      radiation and NHL are warranted for etiologic understanding and public health 
      recommendations.

      stent or subsequent stent restenosis would cause late occlusion of perforators. 
      METHODS: We compared the baseline and poststent (>or=4 months) MRI scans of 
      patients who underwent self-expanding stenting for recurrent ischemic symptoms 
      attributed to a MCA stenosis >or=60%. New infarcts in the ipsilateral 
      striatocapsular region were recorded. RESULTS: MCA stenting was technically 
      successful in 23 of 24 recruited patients. No new perforator territory infarct 
      was found in follow-up MRI scans of all recruited patients. Postoperatively, all 
      patients reported no further TIA or stroke over a median follow-up of 15 months. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The use of a self-expanding stent in patients with high-grade MCA 
      stenosis may not pose a major risk to the perforators.

TI  - A novel strategy utilizing ultrasound for antigen delivery in dendritic

PG  - 198-205

AB  - In dendritic cell (DC)-based cancer immunotherapy, it is important that DCs 
      present peptides derived from tumor-associated antigens on MHC class I, and 
      activate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). However, MHC class I 
      generally present endogenous antigens expressed in the cytosol. We therefore 
      developed an innovative approach capable of directly delivering exogenous 
      antigens into the cytosol of DCs; i.e., a MHC class I-presenting pathway. In this 
      study, we investigated the effect of antigen delivery using perfluoropropane 
      gas-entrapping liposomes (Bubble liposomes, BLs) and ultrasound (US) exposure on 
      MHC class I presentation levels in DCs, as well as the feasibility of using this 
      antigen delivery system in DC-based cancer immunotherapy. DCs were treated with 
      ovalbumin (OVA) as a model antigen, BLs and US exposure. OVA was directly 
      delivered into the cytosol but not via the endocytosis pathway, and OVA-derived 
      peptides were presented on MHC class I. This result indicates that exogenous 
      antigens can be recognized as endogenous antigens when delivered into the 
      cytosol. Immunization with DCs treated with OVA, BLs and US exposure efficiently 
      induced OVA-specific CTLs and resulted in the complete rejection of E.G7-OVA 
      tumors. These data indicate that the combination of BLs and US exposure is a 
      promising antigen delivery system in DC-based cancer immunotherapy.

TI  - Phase II study of weekly plitidepsin as second-line therapy for small cell lung 
      cancer.
PG  - 60-5
LID - 10.1016/j.lungcan.2008.06.017 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antitumor activity and safety profile of plitidepsin 
      administered as a 1h weekly intravenous (i.v.) infusion of 3.2mg/m(2) to patients 
      with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) who relapsed or progressed after one line of 
      chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a multicenter, open-label, 
      single-arm, exploratory, phase II clinical trial. Treatment lasted until disease 
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, patient refusal or treatment delay for >2 
      weeks. Objective response rate (primary efficacy endpoint) was evaluated 
      according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST). The rate of 
      stable disease (SD) lasting for at least 6 months and time-to-event variables 
      were secondary endpoints of efficacy. Toxicity was assessed using National Cancer 
      Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) version 2.0. RESULTS: Twenty 
      pretreated SCLC patients (median age, 60 years) with extensive (n = 13) or 
      limited-stage disease (n = 7) received a total of 24 treatment cycles (median, 
      one cycle per patient; range, 1-2). Objective tumor responses were not observed 
      and only one of the 17 evaluable patients had SD. With a median follow-up of 11.8 
      months, the progression-free survival and the median overall survival were 1.3 
      months and 4.8 months, respectively. The most troubling or common toxicities were 
      fatigue, muscle weakness, lymphopenia, anemia (no patients showed neutropenia), 
      and asymptomatic, non-cumulative increase of transaminases levels and alkaline 
      phosphatase. CONCLUSION: This clinical trial shows that a cycle of 1h weekly i.v. 
      infusion of plitidepsin (3.2mg/m(2)) was generally well tolerated other than 
      fatigue and muscle weakness in patients with pretreated SCLC. One patient died 
      due to multi-organ failure. The absence of antitumor activity found here 
      precludes further studies of this plitidepsin schedule as second-line 
      single-agent treatment of SCLC.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the morbidity secondary to ultrasound-guided systematic 
      prostate biopsy in Japan. METHODS: Five hundred and forty-eight principal 
      urological training institutions certified by the Japanese Urological Association 
      participated in the survey. A retrospective analysis of complications after 
      prostate biopsy was conducted. RESULTS: Medical records of 212 065 procedures 
      carried out between 2004 and 2006 were reviewed. Seventy-six percent of 
      procedures had been carried out transrectally, and 23% transperineally. 
      Hematuria, rectal bleeding and hematospermia occurred in 12%, 5.9% and 1.2% of 
      cases, respectively. Voiding symptoms were reported after biopsy in 1.9% of cases 
      and urinary retention in 1.1%. Fever (>38 degrees C) was observed in 1.1% and 
      sepsis occurred in 0.07%. Hospitalization was required in 0.69% of cases for the 
      treatment of biopsy-related complications. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, contemporary 
      ultrasound-guided systematic prostate biopsy is safely carried out in Japan. 
      However, minor complications are not infrequent, whereas major ones remain very 
      rare but life-threatening if they occur. Thus, adequate information should be 
      provided to patients undergoing prostate biopsy.

TI  - A novel yeast-based tool to detect mutagenic and recombinogenic effects 
      simultaneously.
PG  - 20-9
LID - 10.1016/j.mrgentox.2007.11.007 [doi]
AB  - In this work, we describe a new yeast-based assay to allow efficient detection of 
      a comprehensive spectrum of genotoxicity events. The constructed diploid 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain allows the simultaneous monitoring of forward 
      mutations, mitotic recombination events and chromosome loss or non-disjunction by 
      direct selection in an easy and highly reproducible approach. The strain contains 
      a DNA module consisting of a single functional copy of the URA3 gene and the 
      kanMX4 gene inserted at the ADE2 locus on the right arm of chromosome XV. The 
      changes of the genotype within the marker region were primarily selected on 
      5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) agar plates. Further simple phenotypic tests of the 
      5-FOA-resistant ura3 clones make it possible to analyze the genetic configuration 
      in detail (e.g. point mutations in URA3, gene conversion, crossing-over and 
      chromosome loss). We demonstrate the successful application of our test system by 
      studying the effects of well-known genotoxic agents (UV radiation, 
      N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, aniline and benomyl). We found that the 
      various agents induced mutations and recombination events with different relative 
      frequencies. The integration of the module has generated a hot spot region of 
      mutation and recombination at the borders of the artificially integrated URA3 
      kanMX4 cassette, which makes the system more sensitive towards DNA-damaging 
      agents. Unlike other test systems, our S. cerevisiae strain is capable to detect 
      a mutagenic effect caused by aniline.

TI  - Tooth whitening clinical trials: a global perspective.
PG  - 3A-6A
AB  - Tooth whitening has been the subject of extensive clinical trials research since 
      the introduction of the first hydrogen-peroxide whitening strips in 2000. 
      Availability of digital image analysis, an unambiguous and reproducible method 
      for assessing color change, has contributed to global clinical research and 
      product development on whitening strips. The research has included a series of 
      global randomized controlled trials in distinct sites and cultures, involving 
      6-6.5% hydrogen peroxide whitening strips used for 7-21 days. These studies, 
      conducted at research hospitals, dental schools, and private dental practice, 
      demonstrated significant color improvement with whitening strips relative to 
      baseline and/or various controls without serious adverse events. This integrated 
      clinical trials research provides important evidence of long-term safety and 
      effectiveness of tooth whitening with 6-6.5% hydrogen peroxide whitening strips.

TI  - Post-ischaemic treatment with the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor nimesulide reduces 
      blood-brain barrier disruption and leukocyte infiltration following transient 
      focal cerebral ischaemia in rats.
PG  - 1108-20
AB  - Several studies suggest that cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 plays a pivotal role in the 
      progression of ischaemic brain damage. In the present study, we investigated the 
      effects of selective inhibition of COX-2 with nimesulide (12 mg/kg) and selective 
      inhibition of COX-1 with valeryl salicylate (VAS, 12-120 mg/kg) on prostaglandin 
      E(2) (PGE(2)) levels, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, Evans blue (EB) 
      extravasation and infarct volume in a standardized model of transient focal 
      cerebral ischaemia in the rat. Post-ischaemic treatment with nimesulide markedly 
      reduced the increase in PGE(2) levels in the ischaemic cerebral cortex 24 h after 
      stroke and diminished infarct size by 48% with respect to vehicle-treated animals 
      after 3 days of reperfusion. Furthermore, nimesulide significantly attenuated the 
      blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage and leukocyte infiltration (as measured by EB 
      leakage and MPO activity, respectively) seen at 48 h after the initial ischaemic 
      episode. These studies provide the first experimental evidence that COX-2 
      inhibition with nimesulide is able to limit BBB disruption and leukocyte 
      infiltration following transient focal cerebral ischaemia. Neuroprotection 
      afforded by nimesulide is observed even when the treatment is delayed until 6 h 
      after the onset of ischaemia, confirming a wide therapeutic window of COX-2 
      inhibitors in experimental stroke. On the contrary, selective inhibition of COX-1 
      with VAS had no significant effect on the evaluated parameters. These data 
      suggest that COX-2 activity, but not COX-1 activity, contributes to the 
      progression of focal ischaemic brain injury, and that the beneficial effects 
      observed with non-selective COX inhibitors are probably associated to COX-2 
      rather than to COX-1 inhibition.

TI  - Impact of adjuvant therapy and mammography on U.S. mortality from 1975 to 2000: 
      comparison of mortality results from the cisnet breast cancer base case analysis.
PG  - 112-21
AB  - The CISNET breast cancer program is a consortium of seven research groups 
      modeling the impact of various cancer interventions on the national trends of 
      breast cancer incidence and mortality. Each of the modeling groups participated 
      in a CISNET breast cancer base case analysis with the objective of assessing the 
      impact of mammography and adjuvant therapy on breast cancer mortality between 
      1975 and 2000. The comparative modeling approach used to address this question 
      allowed for a unique view into the process of modeling. Results shown here expand 
      on those recently reported in the New England Journal of Medicine (Berry et al., 
      N Engl J Med 2005;353:1784-92) by presenting mortality impact in several 
      different ways to facilitate comparisons between models. Comparisons of each 
      group's results in the context of modeling assumptions made during the process 
      gave insight into how specific model assumptions may have affected the results. 
      The median estimate for the percent decline in breast cancer mortality due to 
      mammography was 15% (range of 8%-23%), and the median estimate for the percent 
      decline in mortality due to adjuvant treatment was 19% (range of 12%-21%). A 
      detailed discussion of the differences in modeling approaches and how those 
      differences may have influenced the mortality results concludes the chapter.

TI  - Antioxidant micronutrients in major trauma and burns: evidence and practice.
PG  - 438-49
AB  - There has been a growing interest in micronutrients as a result of their 
      essential role in endogenous antioxidant defense mechanisms and immunity. 
      Critically ill burn and trauma patients are characterized by an increased free 
      radical production, which is proportional to the severity of the injury. In 
      addition, they are at high risk of negative trace element balances, which 
      contribute to the imbalance in endogenous antioxidant capacity and the extension 
      of primary lesions. Although selenium, zinc, and vitamin C and E status are 
      altered in all injured patients, patients with major burns are unique for having 
      copper deficiency. In major burns, high-dose ascorbic acid for 24 hours achieves 
      reduction of resuscitation fluid requirements by endothelial antioxidant 
      mechanisms both in animal models and in 1 human trial. Supplementation trials in 
      trauma and burns including selenium and zinc have shown that early provision of 
      micronutrients improves recovery. Vitamin supplementation trials without selenium 
      have not achieved definitive effects. The human studies show that reinforcing 
      antioxidant defenses early in the course of major injury is rational and that 
      substituting the large initial micronutrient losses of selenium and zinc is safe 
      in trauma, as is the addition of copper in burns. The IV route seems the only way 
      to deliver the doses required to obtain a clinical effect.

PG  - 223-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Late-onset depression with vascular brain lesions is showing 
      increased resistance to antidepressive pharmacotherapy. AIM: To give an overview 
      of alternative treatment options. METHOD: We conducted a literature search via 
      PubMed using the key words: 'late-onset depression', 'white matter lesions', 
      'cerebrovascular pathology' and 'treatment' and thereby a searchfor all available 
      clinical studies about the treatment described in combination with the key words 
      'vascular depression', or 'late-onset depression' and 'white matter lesions'. 
      RESULTS: Electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation 
      and nimodipine au,gmentation have beneficial effects on vascular depression. 
      CONCLUSION: The treatment options mentioned are promising, but there is a need 
      for further clinical studies.

TI  - Use of drotrecogin alfa (activated) in older patients with severe sepsis.
PG  - 533-8
AB  - Drotrecogin alfa (activated) has been approved by the United States Food and Drug 
      Administration for treatment of patients at high risk of death from severe 
      sepsis. Severe sepsis is common, and its occurrence increases dramatically with 
      age. Clinical use data, however, suggest that drotrecogin alfa (activated) may be 
      underused in older patients, possibly due to concern over the drug's 
      anticoagulant effects and perceived high cost. In addition, clinicians often 
      treat older patients less aggressively than younger patients. We reviewed a 
      subgroup analysis of patients aged 75 years and older from a large clinical trial 
      evaluating efficacy and safety of drotrecogin alfa (activated), as well as 
      cost-effectiveness data from real-world clinical use of the drug in older 
      patients. We also explored ethical dilemmas of treating older patients with 
      sepsis. Drotrecogin alfa (activated) is safe, effective, and cost-effective in 
      older patients with severe sepsis and should be considered for elderly intensive 
      care patients who are high risk of death and who have no contraindications to 
      treatment.

TI  - Induction therapy with basiliximab allows delayed initiation of cyclosporine and 
      preserves renal function after cardiac transplantation.
PG  - 1327-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cyclosporine (CsA) is frequently initiated as induction therapy in 
      patients undergoing orthotopic heart transplantation, but our experience has 
      identified a significant rate of post-operative renal dysfunction. We therefore 
      devised a renal-sparing cyclosporine-free induction regimen consisting of the 
      early administration basiliximab, an interleukin-2 receptor monoclonal antibody, 
      followed by the late initiation of cyclosporine on post-operative Day 4. METHODS: 
      Between September 1998 and December 1999, we treated 25 patients at risk for 
      post-operative renal dysfunction (high-risk basiliximab group) with the new 
      induction regimen and another 33 patients not at risk (low-risk CsA group) for 
      renal dysfunction with our standard cyclosporine protocol. We identified a 
      historical control group (1996 through 1998) of 32 patients at risk for renal 
      dysfunction (high-risk CsA group) who had received our standard cyclosporine 
      protocol. RESULTS: The increase in serum creatinine levels after transplantation 
      was less in the high-risk basiliximab group (-0.1 +/- 0.7) than in the high-risk 
      CsA group (0.5 +/- 1.0, p < 0.02) and comparable to the low-risk CsA group (0.03 
      +/- 0.6). The basiliximab protocol did not increase rejection; the percentage of 
      rejection episodes was high-risk basiliximab, 0; high-risk CsA, 13; and low-risk 
      CsA, 3 (p = .13). CONCLUSION: Basiliximab induction therapy allows delayed 
      initiation of cyclosporine after cardiac transplantation without an increase in 
      rejection and reduces the risk of post-operative renal dysfunction.

TI  - Statistics of protein library construction.
PG  - 3314-5
AB  - We have investigated the statistics associated with constructing and sampling 
      large protein-encoding libraries. Using fairly simple statistics we have written 
      algorithms for estimating the diversity in libraries generated by the most 
      commonly used protocols, including error-prone PCR, DNA shuffling, StEP PCR, 
      oligonucleotide-directed randomization, MAX randomization, synthetic shuffling, 
      DHR, ADO and SISDC. AVAILABILITY: Web interface and C++ source code available at

TI  - Protective effects of ascorbic acid, DL-alpha-tocopherol acetate, and sodium 
      selenate on ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury of rats.
PG  - 173-89
AB  - In this study, the effect of ascorbic acid (vitamin C), DL-alpha-tocopherol 
      acetate (vitamin E), and sodium selenate (selenium) on ethanol-induced gastric 
      mucosal injury in rats was investigated morphologically and biochemically. The 
      gastric mucosal injury was produced by administration of 1 mL of absolute ethanol 
      to each rat. Animals received vitamin C (250 mg/kg), vitamin E (250 mg/kg), and 
      selenium (0.5 mg/kg) for 3 d 1 h prior to the administration of absolute ethanol. 
      In gastric mucosa of rats given ethanol according to control groups, neuronal 
      nitric oxide expression decreased. This immunoreactivity was much lower in the 
      group given ethanol+vitamin C+vitamin E+selenium than the control group and the 
      ethanol-induced group. Scanning electron microscopic evaluation of the 
      ethanol-induced group, when compared to control groups, revealed degenerative 
      changes in gastric mucosa, whereas a good arrangement in surface topography of 
      gastric mucosa in the group given ethanol + vitamin C+vitamin E + selenium was 
      observed. In the group administered ethanol, a reduction of the stomach 
      glutathione (GSH) and serum total protein levels and increases in serum sialic 
      acid, triglycerides, and stomach lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels were observed. 
      Vitamin C+vitamin E+Se administration to alcohol-treated rats significantly 
      increased the serum total protein, triglyceride levels, and stomach GSH levels 
      and significantly lowered the levels of serum sialic acid and stomach LPO 
      compared to untreated alcohol-supplemented rats. As a result of these findings, 
      we can say that the combination of vitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium has a 
      protective effect on ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury of rats.

TI  - Surface area of respirable beryllium metal, oxide, and copper alloy aerosols and 
      implications for assessment of exposure risk of chronic beryllium disease.
PG  - 297-305
AB  - The continued occurrence of chronic beryllium disease (CBD) suggests the current 
      occupational exposure limit of 2 microg beryllium per cubic meter of air does not 
      adequately protect workers. This study examined the morphology and measured the 
      particle surface area of aerodynamically size-separated powders and 
      process-sampled particles of beryllium metal, beryllium oxide, and 
      copper-beryllium alloy. The beryllium metal powder consisted of compact 
      particles, whereas the beryllium oxide powder and particles were clusters of 
      smaller primary particles. Specific surface area (SSA) results for all samples 
      (N=30) varied by a factor of 37, from 0.56 +/- 0.07 m(2)/g (for the 0.4-0.7 
      microm size fraction of the process-sampled reduction furnace particles) to 20.8 
      +/- 0.4 m(2)/g (for the </=0.4 microm size fraction of the metal powder). Large 
      relative differences in SSA were observed as a function of particle size for the 
      powder of beryllium metal, from 4.0 +/- 0.01 m(2)/g (for the particle size 
      fraction >6 microm) to 20.8 +/- 0.44 m(2)/g (for the particle size fraction 
      </=0.4 microm). In contrast, little relative difference in SSA (<25%) was 
      observed as a function of particle size for the beryllium oxide powder and 
      particles collected from the screening operation. The SSA of beryllium metal 
      powder decreases with increasing particle size, as expected for compact 
      particles, and the SSA of the beryllium oxide powders and particles remains 
      constant as a function of particle size, which might be expected for clustered 
      particles. These associations illustrate how process-related factors can 
      influence the morphology and SSA of beryllium materials. To avoid errors in 
      predicting bioavailability of beryllium and the associated risks for CBD, the 
      mechanisms of particle formation should be understood and the SSA of beryllium 
      particles should be measured directly.

TI  - Assessment of mercury exposure and malaria in a Brazilian Amazon riverine 
      community.
PG  - 69-75
AB  - Small-scale gold mining in the Brazilian Amazon occurs in areas with high rates 
      of malaria transmission. Amazonian populations can be exposed to mercury through 
      direct contact with the mining process and/or through fish consumption. Because 
      of data from experimental studies, we examined the potential for mercury to 
      affect host response to malaria. A cross-sectional survey was done in 
      Jacareacanga, a riverine community in Para state, in a region of intense alluvial 
      gold mining. A sample of 205 persons was selected by cluster sampling from the 
      total population of approximately 2000. A brief medical history and exam were 
      conducted, malaria slides were obtained, and hair samples were taken to measure 
      mercury levels. The average hair mercury level was 8.6 micrograms/g, ranging from 
      0.3 to 83.2 micrograms/g. The most important predictors of elevated mercury 
      levels were high fish consumption and low income. Although there was no prevalent 
      malaria, the odds of reporting a past malaria infection was four times higher for 
      those also reporting a history of working with mercury.

TI  - Evaluation of the chemotherapy patient monitor: an interactive tool for 
      facilitating communication between patients and oncologists during the cancer 
      consultation.
PG  - 115-23
AB  - Effective communication between oncologists and patients with cancer is of 
      paramount importance. The Chemotherapy Patient Monitor (CPM) is a novel tool 
      designed to assist doctor-patient communication regarding patient concerns and 
      side-effects. Initially, the CPM was assessed in a primary evaluation study of 
      its use during consultations with 26 patients with advanced colorectal cancer 
      (one consultation without, followed by two with, the CPM per patient). This led 
      to a further dissemination/audit of 34 patients attending oncology centres in the 
      UK, who had completed the survey prior to three consultations. The CPM contains a 
      checklist of common side-effects of chemotherapy regimens used in advanced 
      colorectal cancer, and other common concerns of patients with advanced colorectal 
      cancer. The CPM records the presence of side-effects/concerns, the distress 
      caused, whether patients wish to discuss them further, and actions taken as a 
      result. Questionnaires explored the views of patients and oncologists in the UK 
      and Spain regarding the effectiveness of consultations during a baseline visit 
      conducted without the CPM, and then with the CPM in subsequent visits. These data 
      were then complemented by the dissemination/audit study of the CPM across nine 
      centres in the UK. All patients understood the CPM. The CPM was rated as useful 
      by oncologists in 83% of consultations, and did not lengthen 82% of visits. 
      Patients felt it had improved the visit in 95% of cases. Responses from patients 
      (100%) and oncologists (84%) indicated willingness to use the CPM for at least 
      some consultations in the future. The results of the dissemination/audit study 
      supported these conclusions. We conclude that the CPM appears to be a useful new 
      tool for improving patient-doctor communication during cancer consultations.

TI  - Implantable cardioverter defibrillator trials: what's new?
PG  - 29-35
AB  - The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) has been in clinical use for 20 
      years and its clinical role is becoming increasingly clear. A number of 
      well-designed trials demonstrated its effectiveness in high-risk patients who 
      have already experienced a malignant arrhythmia. A more controversial role for 
      the ICD is in patients who are at high risk but have not yet had an arrhythmic 
      event. Randomized clinical trials published in the late 1990s demonstrated 
      survival benefit with the ICD in narrowly defined high-risk populations. These 
      populations are presently defined by a low ejection fraction and inducible 
      ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Clinical trials still in progress will determine 
      whether broader populations will benefit from prophylactic ICD implantation. 
      These trials will have broad clinical importance.

TI  - The importance of the refeeding syndrome.
PG  - 632-7
AB  - In this review we discuss the refeeding syndrome. This potentially lethal 
      condition can be defined as severe electrolyte and fluid shifts associated with 
      metabolic abnormalities in malnourished patients undergoing refeeding, whether 
      orally, enterally, or parenterally. It can be associated with significant 
      morbidity and mortality. Clinical features are fluid-balance abnormalities, 
      abnormal glucose metabolism, hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypokalemia. 
      In addition, thiamine deficiency can occur. We describe which patient groups are 
      more at risk for this syndrome and the clinical management of the condition.

TI  - Lymphoproliferative disorders in renal transplant patients in Japan.
PG  - 869-75
AB  - Post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders (PT-LPD) are characterized by 
      a clinically and morphologically heterogeneous group of lymphoid proliferation 
      occurring after organ or bone marrow transplantation. The immunodeficient state 
      provides a basis for lymphomagenesis probably through activation of oncogenic 
      viruses. Twenty-four patients in whom PT-LPD developed after renal 
      transplantation in Japan were analyzed. They received hemodialysis for 4 to 226 
      (median 13) months before transplantation. In situ hybridization was performed to 
      detect Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Polymerase chain reaction and Southern 
      hybridization with primers in the tax and pol regions of human T-cell leukemia 
      virus type I (HTLV-1) were performed on DNA extracted from paraffin-embedded 
      specimens. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that 12 cases were B-cell type, 
      10 cases (42%) T-cell type and 2 NK-cell type. Five of the T-cell cases were 
      classified as adult T-cell lymphoma with proven HTLV-1 genome in the tumor and 
      seropositivity for the virus. These cases were classified as adult T-cell 
      lymphoma (ALT). More than 80% of B-cell, 30% of T-cell and both NK/T-cell 
      lymphomas were EBV-positive. Co-infection of EBV and HTLV-1 was found in 2 cases 
      with ATL. These findings showed that ATL is common among Japanese renal 
      transplant patients, which might be due to transmission of HTLV-1 via blood 
      transfusion during hemodialysis.

TI  - Immunohistochemical study of the receptors for retinoic acid in prostatic 
      adenocarcinoma.
PG  - 3897-902
AB  - BACKGROUND: Retinoids play an important role in regulating cellular proliferation 
      and differentiation. Although their effects are mediated by retinoic acid 
      receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs), limited information is 
      available about the expression of RARs and RXRs in prostatic adenocarcinoma. We 
      intended in this study to elucidate further the participation of those receptors 
      in tumor progression of human prostate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 
      immunohistochemical expression of RARs and RXRs proteins was studied using 
      paraffin-embedded archival tissues obtained from patients with and without 
      neoadjuvant hormonal therapies for prostatic adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: The 
      immunoreactivity against RAR-alpha, RAR-gamma, RXR-alpha and RXR-gamma were 
      detected in many, if not all, prostatic adenocarcinoma cells of the cases without 
      and with neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, whereas less expression of both RAR-beta 
      and RXR-beta were identified. Positively stained adenocarcinoma cells with 
      RAR-beta and RXR-beta were found to be decreased in the cases with neoadjuvant 
      therapy. In addition, the specimens showing positive immunoreaction of RAR-beta 
      were limited to the cases of moderately- and poorly-differentiated but not 
      well-differentiated, adenocarcinomas. CONCLUSION: We first demonstrated the 
      expression of RARs and RXRs proteins in prostatic adenocarcinoma using 
      subtype-specific antibodies. Immunohistochemistry using those antibodies might 
      give an indication of susceptibility of the patients to retinoid therapy as a 
      possible treatment of prostatic adenocarcinoma.

      platelet-rich fibrin alone: Randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 691

LID - 691
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the clinical benefits of adding NanoBone((R)) with 
      split-crest technique and simultaneous implant placement covered with 
      platelet-rich fibrin membrane in horizontally deficient maxillary ridges in terms 
      of crestal and horizontal bone changes and patient morbidity. METHODS: Forty 
      patients indicated for maxillary ridge splitting and simultaneous implant 
      placement were assigned randomly to the study groups: control group (Platelet 
      Rich Fibrin membrane) and test group (Platelet Rich Fibrin 
      membrane + Nanobone((R))). The Cone Beam Computed Tomography Fusion technique was 
      utilized to assess crestal and horizontal bone changes after five months of the 
      surgical procedure. Patient morbidity was recorded for one week post-surgical. 
      RESULTS: Five months post-surgical, buccal crestal bone resorption was 
      1.26 +/- 0.58 mm for the control group and 1.14 +/- 0.63 mm for the test group. 
      Lingual crestal bone resorption was 1.40 +/- 0.66 mm for the control group and 
      1.47 +/- 0.68 mm for the test group. Horizontal bone width gain was 1.46 +/- 0.44 mm 
      for the control group and 1.29 +/- 0.73 mm for the test group. There was no 
      significant statistical difference between study groups regarding crestal and 
      horizontal bone changes and patient morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: The tomographic 
      assessment of NanoBone((R)) addition in this study resulted in no statistically 
      significant difference between study groups regarding crestal and horizontal bone 
      changes and patient morbidity. More randomized controlled clinical trials on gap 
      fill comparing different bone grafting materials versus no grafting should be 
      conducted. GOV REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02836678, 13(th) January 2017.

AB  - The inclusion of patient representatives as study consultants brings diverse 
      perspectives, insights, and experiences to clinical trial design and execution, 
      and their role in the clinical trial development process is being increasingly 
      recognized and valued. The APPETIZE study evaluated the palatability of, and 
      preference for, three potassium binders for treating hyperkalemia in patients 
      with chronic kidney disease. A core aspect of the development of this study was 
      the inclusion of a patient representative during the design stage. Here, I 
      describe the process of patient involvement in the APPETIZE study design 
      (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04566653), the resultant positive impacts, and 
      key learnings. A patient with chronic kidney disease was invited to be a member 
      of the APPETIZE trial design team. This patient representative attended study 
      team meetings and provided invaluable input into protocol development, 
      questionnaire selection, design of patient information sheets and consent forms, 
      and primary manuscript structure. These critical insights resulted in an enhanced 
      trial design and generation of high-quality, patient-relevant data. APPETIZE 
      provides an excellent example of a patient preference study that relied on input 
      from multiple stakeholder groups, including, most notably, the patients 
      themselves. This approach may serve as a model for early and deep patient 
      engagement in the design and interpretation of clinical trials.

TI  - A model-assisted design for partially or completely ordered groups.
LID - 10.1002/pst.2396 [doi]
AB  - This paper proposes a trial design for locating group-specific doses when groups 
      are partially or completely ordered by dose sensitivity. Previous trial designs 
      for partially ordered groups are model-based, whereas the proposed method is 
      model-assisted, providing clinicians with a design that is simpler. The proposed 
      method performs similarly to model-based methods, providing simplicity without 
      losing accuracy. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, the proposed method 
      is the first paper on dose-finding for partially ordered groups with convergence 
      results. To generalize the proposed method, a framework is introduced that allows 
      partial orders to be transferred to a grid format with a known ordering across 
      rows but an unknown ordering within rows.

AB  - Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is one of the main injuries in 
      professional and amateur athletes of different sports. Hundreds of thousands of 
      ACL ruptures occurs annually, and only 55% of the athletes return to competitive 
      level, with a 15 times higher chance of suffering a second injury. 60% of these 
      injuries occur without physical contact and since they occur in the acute 
      process, they can cause joint effusion, muscle weakness and functional 
      incapacity. In the long term, they can contribute to a premature process of 
      osteoarthritis. This narrative review is of particular interest for clinicians, 
      practitioners, coaches and athletes to understand the main factors that 
      contribute to an injury and/or re-injury and thus, to optimize their training to 
      reduce and/or prevent the risk of injury and/or reinjury of ACL. Therefore, we 
      aimed reports a narrative overview of the literature surrounding communication 
      and explore through a theoretical review, the main risk factors for an ACL injury 
      and/or re-injury, as well as bringing practical and correct methods of training 
      applications. The lack of theoretical/practical knowledge on the part of 
      rehabilitation and/or training professionals may impair the treatment of an 
      athlete and/or student. High-quality research that can testing different training 
      methods approaches in randomized controlled trials is needed.

AB  - For many cancers there are only a few well-established risk factors. Here, we use 
      summary data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in a Mendelian 
      randomisation (MR) phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) to identify 
      potentially causal relationships for over 3,000 traits. Our outcome datasets 
      comprise 378,142 cases across breast, prostate, colorectal, lung, endometrial, 
      oesophageal, renal, and ovarian cancers, as well as 485,715 controls. We 
      complement this analysis by systematically mining the literature space for 
      supporting evidence. In addition to providing supporting evidence for 
      well-established risk factors (smoking, alcohol, obesity, lack of physical 
      activity), we also find sex steroid hormones, plasma lipids, and telomere length 
      as determinants of cancer risk. A number of the molecular factors we identify may 
      prove to be potential biomarkers. Our analysis, which highlights aetiological 
      similarities and differences in common cancers, should aid public health 
      prevention strategies to reduce cancer burden. We provide a R/Shiny app to 
      visualise findings.

TI  - Community-level variation in TB testing history in Blantyre, Malawi.
PG  - 99-105
LID - 10.5588/ijtld.23.0213 [doi]
AB  - SETTING: Equitable access to TB testing is vital for achieving global diagnosis 
      and treatment targets, but access to diagnostic services is often worse in poorer 
      communities. The SCALE (Sustainable Community-wide Active case-finding for Lung 
      hEalth) survey estimated TB prevalence in Blantyre City, Malawi, and recorded 
      previous engagement with TB services.OBJECTIVE: To explore local variation in the 
      prevalence of ever-testing for TB in Blantyre and investigate potential 
      socio-economic drivers.DESIGN: We fit a mixed-effects model to self-reported 
      prior TB testing from survey participants across 72 neighbourhood clusters, 
      adjusted for sex, age and HIV status and with cluster-level random intercepts. We 
      then evaluated to what extent cluster-level variation was explained by two 
      alternate poverty indicators.RESULTS: We observed substantial variation between 
      clusters in previous TB testing, with little correlation between neighbouring 
      clusters. Individuals residing in less affluent households, on average, had lower 
      odds of having undergone prior testing. However, adjusting for poverty did not 
      explain the cluster-level variations observed.CONCLUSION: Despite a decade of 
      increased active case-finding efforts, access to TB testing is inconsistent 
      across the population of Blantyre. This likely reflects health inequities that 
      also apply to TB testing in many other settings, and motivates collection and 
      analysis of TB testing data to identify the drivers behind these inequities.

TI  - Evaluation of antimicrobial photodynamic action of a pluronic and pectin based 
      film loaded with methylene blue against methicillin resistantStaphylococcus 
      aureus.
LID - 10.1088/1748-605X/ad1bb3 [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobial wound dressings play a crucial role in treatment of wound 
      infections. However, existing commercial options fall short due to antibiotic 
      resistance and the limited spectrum of activity of newly emerging antimicrobials 
      against bacteria that are frequently encountered in wound infections. 
      Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is very promising alternative 
      therapeutic approach against antibiotic resistant microbes such as methicillin 
      resistantStaphylococcus aureus (MRSA). However, delivery of the photosensitizer 
      (PS) homogeneously to the wound site is a challenge. Though polymeric wound 
      dressings based on synthetic and biopolymers are being explored for aPDT, there 
      is paucity of data regarding theirin vivoefficacy. Moreover, there are no studies 
      on use of PS loaded, pluoronic (PL) and pectin (PC) based films for aPDT. We 
      report development of a polymeric film for potential use in aPDT. The film was 
      prepared using PL and PC via solvent casting approach and impregnated with 
      methylene blue (MB) for photodynamic inactivation of MRSAin vitroandin vivo. 
      Atomic force microscopic imaging of the films yielded vivid pictures of surface 
      topography, with rough surfaces, pores, and furrows. The PL:PC ratio (2:3) was 
      optimized that would result in an intact film but exhibit rapid release of MB in 
      time scale suitable for aPDT. The film showed good antibacterial activity against 
      planktonic suspension, biofilm of MRSA upon exposure to red light. Investigations 
      on MRSA infected excisional wounds of mice reveal that topical application of MB 
      loaded film for 30 min followed by red light exposure for 5 min (fluence;  approximately 30 J 
      cm(-2)) or 10 min (fluence;  approximately 60 J cm(-2)) reduces  approximately 80% or  approximately 92% of bioburden, 
      respectively. Importantly, the film elicits no significant cytotoxicity against 
      keratinocytes and human adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells. Taken together, 
      our data demonstrate that PS-loaded PL-PC based films are a promising new tool 
      for treatment of MRSA infected wounds.

TI  - Prebiotics and sepsis in infants: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis.
LID - 10.17219/acem/174307 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a critical situation, and its treatment and reduction are 
      important clinical issues. Antibiotics are a routine treatment option, but their 
      adverse effects are a concern in pediatric patients, especially infants. 
      Prebiotics might be an alternative option. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was 
      to provide an updated systemic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled 
      trials (RCTs) on the use of prebiotics for sepsis in infants, which could assist 
      clinicians in deciding whether to use this treatment. METHODS: The study included 
      RCTs related to prebiotics and sepsis in infants. A random effects model and the 
      odds ratio (OR) were applied to estimate the effect of prebiotic use and the 
      incidence of sepsis in infants. The analysis included 16 studies with a total of 
      6,438 infants. The primary outcome was the OR of sepsis for infants who received 
      prebiotics. RESULTS: The results of the meta-analysis demonstrated that the 
      pooled OR of sepsis was significantly lower for infants who used prebiotics. 
      However, the results indicated a medium level of heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: The 
      results showed that the use of prebiotics might be associated with a reduction of 
      sepsis in infants. The standardized application of this treatment might be an 
      intriguing topic for future clinical research.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to evaluate the exposure to a diet naturally 
      contaminated with mycotoxins on lactation performance, animal health, and the 
      ability to sequester agents (SA) to reduce the human exposure to AFM(1). Sixty 
      healthy lactating Holstein cows were randomly assigned to two groups: naturally 
      contaminated diet without and with the addition of a SA (20 g/cow/d 
      AntitoxCooPil(R) -60% zeolite-40% cell wall-). Each cow was monitored throughout 
      lactation. The concentration of aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1)) in feed and M(1) (AFM(1)) 
      in milk, health status, and productive and reproductive parameters were measured. 
      AFB(1) concentration in feed was very low (2.31 mug/kgDM). The addition of SA 
      reduced the milk AFM(1) concentrations (0.016 vs. 0.008 mug/kg) and transfer rates 
      (2.19 vs. 0.77%). No differences were observed in health status, production and 
      reproduction performance. The inclusion of SA in the diet of dairy cows reduce 
      the risk in the most susceptible population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one of the most 
      commonly encountered pathogens among burn patients incurring substantial 
      morbidity and mortality. To investigate the epidemiology and features of MRSA in 
      burn wound infections, we conducted a 10-year retrospective study on MRSA 
      isolated from burn patients with burn wound infections from southeast China from 
      2013 to 2022. METHODS: One hundred MRSA isolates (10 isolates each year) from 
      burn wound infection among burn patients from 2013 to 2022 were randomly selected 
      and enrolled. In addition to the clinical data of the 100 burn patients, MRSA 
      isolates were characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, detection of 
      toxin genes, and molecular typing. RESULTS: The median time from the onset of 
      burns and admission to MRSA detected was 13 and 5 days, respectively. No MRSA 
      isolate was found resistant to quinupristin/dalfopristin, linezolid, and 
      vancomycin. Toxin gene seg was found most frequently (90%) followed by sea (70%) 
      and eta (64%). CC8 (74%), ST239 (70%), and SCCmec III (72%) were the most common 
      CC, ST, and SCCmec types, respectively. CONCLUSION: ST239-III (70%) was the 
      predominant clone found in MRSA from burn wound infection among burn patients in 
      southeast China. ST239-III was less found from 2018 to 2022. A higher diversity 
      of MRSA clones was observed in these recent 5 years than that from 2013 to 2017.

TI  - Predelivery sonographic predictors of obstetric anal sphincter injury among 
      nulliparous women.
PG  - 801-805
LID - 10.1002/ijgo.15257 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Data available at admission to delivery of nulliparous has rarely been 
      investigated for prediction of obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASI). The aim of 
      the present study was to study risk factors for OASI in nulliparous based on 
      information available at admission. METHODS: A retrospective study of all 
      nulliparous women undergoing labor, during March 2011 to January 2021 was 
      performed. We compared women with OASI following delivery to those without by 
      univariate and multivariable regression. RESULTS: A total of 30 262 deliveries 
      were included and 4181 (13.4%) of those were delivered by an emergent cesarean 
      delivery. OASI followed 453 (1.5%) deliveries. Women in the OASI group were 
      younger 29 +/- 4.4 versus 30 +/- 4.8, P = 0.001. In a multivariable regression 
      analysis, higher sonographic estimated fetal weight was positively associated 
      with OASI occurrence (aOR, 95% CI: 1.13 [1.00-1.29]). Maternal age was inversely 
      associated with OASI occurrence (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 95% confidence 
      interval [CI] 0.95 [0.92-0.97]). CONCLUSION: Sonographic fetal weight estimation 
      is an independent risk factor for OASI occurrence that may be available at 
      admission for delivery among nulliparous women.

TI  - The role of NMDARs in the anesthetic and antidepressant effects of ketamine.
PG  - e14464
LID - 10.1111/cns.14464 [doi]
LID - e14464
AB  - BACKGROUND: As a phencyclidine (PCP) analog, ketamine can generate rapid-onset 
      and substantial anesthetic effects. Contrary to traditional anesthetics, ketamine 
      is a dissociative anesthetic and can induce loss of consciousness in patients. 
      Recently, the subanaesthetic dose of ketamine was found to produce rapid-onset 
      and lasting antidepressant effects. AIM: However, how different concentrations of 
      ketamine can induce diverse actions remains unclear. Furthermore, the molecular 
      mechanisms underlying the NMDAR-mediated anesthetic and antidepressant effects of 
      ketamine are not fully understood. METHOD: In this review, we have introduced 
      ketamine and its metabolism, summarized recent advances in the molecular 
      mechanisms underlying NMDAR inhibition in the anesthetic and antidepressant 
      effects of ketamine, explored the possible functions of NMDAR subunits in the 
      effects of ketamine, and discussed the future directions of ketamine-based 
      anesthetic and antidepressant drugs. RESULT: Both the anesthetic and 
      antidepressant effects of ketamine were thought to be mediated by 
      N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) inhibition. CONCLUSION: The roles of NMDARs 
      have been extensively studied in the anaesthetic effects of ketamine. However, 
      the roles of NMDARs in antidepressant effects of ketamine are complicated and 
      controversial.

TI  - Definition, Phenotyping of Severe Asthma, Including Cluster Analysis.
PG  - 239-252
LID - 10.1007/978-3-031-32259-4_11 [doi]
AB  - Asthma is defined as severe when it is uncontrolled despite the high intensity of 
      treatment, or that loses control when a therapeutic step down is tried.These 
      patients, for years, have been "uniformly" treated with massive doses of inhaled 
      and oral corticosteroids regardless of their inflammatory state.Initially, asthma 
      was considered of genesis "exclusively allergic." Subsequently, thanks to the 
      development of noninvasive tools and of human monoclonal antibodies targeting 
      interleukin 5, a pathogenetic role has been given to eosinophils. Management of 
      steroids based on sputum eosinophil counts has been suggested according to 
      clinical phenotypes identified through cluster analysis.The algorithms obtained 
      from the cluster analysis have proved later to be poorly predictive of the 
      inflammatory phenotype and difficult to apply in clinical practice.In the new era 
      of precision medicine, the greatest challenge is finding clinical or biological 
      elements predictive of response to therapies such as biologics. Cluster analyses 
      performed on omics data or on cohorts of patients treated with biologics are more 
      promising in this sense.In this article, starting from the current definition of 
      severe asthma, we review the phenotypes proposed over time to date, showing the 
      difficulty underlying the process of "phenotyping" due to the scarcity of 
      available biomarkers.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Racial-ethnic disparities in pain management are common but not known 
      among pancreatic disease patients. We sought to evaluate racial-ethnic 
      disparities in opioid prescriptions for pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer 
      patients. METHODS: Data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey were 
      used to examine racial-ethnic and sex differences in opioid prescriptions for 
      ambulatory visits by adult pancreatic disease patients. RESULTS: We identified 
      207 pancreatitis and 196 pancreatic cancer patient visits, representing 9.8 
      million visits, but weights were repealed for analysis. No sex differences in 
      opioid prescriptions were found among pancreatitis (P = 0.78) or pancreatic 
      cancer patient visits (P = 0.57). Opioids were prescribed at 58% of Black, 37% of 
      White, and 19% of Hispanic pancreatitis patient visits (P = 0.05). Opioid 
      prescriptions were less common in Hispanic versus non-Hispanic pancreatitis 
      patients (odds ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.91; P = 0.03). We 
      found no racial-ethnic differences in opioid prescriptions among pancreatic 
      cancer patient visits. CONCLUSIONS: Racial-ethnic disparities in opioid 
      prescriptions were observed in pancreatitis, but not pancreatic cancer patient 
      visits, suggesting possible racial-ethnic bias in opioid prescription practices 
      for patients with benign pancreatic disease. However, there is a lower threshold 
      for opioid provision in the treatment of malignant, terminal disease.

TI  - Sex-Specific Effects on Total Body Fat Gain with 4-Week Daily Dosing of Raspberry 
      Ketone [4-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone] and Ketogenic Diet in Mice.
LID - 10.3390/nu15071630 [doi]
LID - 1630
AB  - Background: Raspberry ketone (RK: [4-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone]) is a dietary 
      supplement marketed for weight control. RK is structurally unrelated to the 
      ketone bodies elevated with a ketogenic diet (KD). This study aims to determine 
      whether RK oral supplementation with KD improves the weight loss outcomes in 
      high-fat diet (HFD; 45% fat)-fed mice. Methods: Male and female C57BL/6J mice 
      were HFD-fed for 9 weeks and switched to KD (80% fat) or a control diet (CD; 10% 
      fat) or continued with the HFD for 4 weeks. Coincident with the diet switch, each 
      diet group received oral RK (200 mg/kg/day) or a vehicle. Results: In male KD-fed 
      mice, oral RK reduced body weight by ~6% (KD_Veh: -9.2 +/- 1% vs. KD_RK: -15.1 +/- 
      1%) and fat composition by ~18% (KD_Veh: -16.0 +/- 4% vs. KD_RK: -34.2 +/- 5%). HFD 
      and KD feeding induced glucose intolerance in both male and female mice. Oral RK 
      decreased the glucose area under the curve in female mice by ~6% (KD_Veh: 44,877 
      +/- 957 vs. KD_RK: 42,040 +/- 675 mg*min/dl). KD also had gut microbiota alterations 
      with higher alpha diversity in males and more beta diversity with RK. These 
      findings suggest sex-specific weight loss effects with RK and KD in mice.

TI  - Evaluating the RIST Molecular-Targeted Regimen in a Three-Dimensional 
      Neuroblastoma Spheroid Cell Culture Model.
LID - 10.3390/cancers15061749 [doi]
LID - 1749
AB  - BACKGROUND: The outcome for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma remains poor 
      and novel treatment strategies are urgently needed. The RIST protocol represents 
      a novel metronomic and multimodal treatment strategy for high-risk neuroblastoma 
      combining molecular-targeted drugs as 'pre-treatment' with a conventional 
      chemotherapy backbone, currently evaluated in a phase II clinical trial. For 
      preclinical drug testing, cancer cell growth as spheroid compared to mo-nolayer 
      cultures is of advantage since it reproduces a wide range of tumor 
      characteristics, including the three-dimensional architecture and cancer stem 
      cell (CSC) properties. The objective of this study was to establish a 
      neuroblastoma spheroid model for the rigorous assessment of the RIST treatment 
      protocol. METHODS: Evaluation of CSC marker expression was performed by mRNA and 
      protein analysis and spheroid viability by luminescence-based assays. Aberrant 
      expression of RNA-binding protein La in neuroblastoma was assessed by tissue 
      microarray analysis and patients' data mining. RESULTS: Spheroid cultures showed 
      increased expression of a subgroup of CSC-like markers (CXCR4, NANOG and BMI) and 
      higher Thr389 phosphorylation of the neuroblastoma-associated RNA-binding protein 
      La when compared to monolayer cultures. Molecular-targeted 'pre-treatment' of 
      spheroids decreased neoplastic signaling and CSC marker expression. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The RIST treatment protocol efficiently reduced the viability of neuroblastoma 
      spheroids characterized by advanced CSC properties.

TI  - Injection of an improperly stored proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 
      monoclonal antibody in a patient with secondary dyslipidemia from nephrotic 
      syndrome: a case report.
PG  - 89
LID - 10.1186/s13256-023-03804-5 [doi]
LID - 89
AB  - BACKGROUND: Elevated plasma cholesterol and/or plasma triglyceride levels in 
      nephrotic syndrome patients are the result of impaired lipoprotein clearance and 
      a compensatory increase in hepatic lipoprotein synthesis. Plasma proprotein 
      convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 levels directly correlate to the amount of 
      proteinuria in nephrotic syndrome patients. Proprotein convertase 
      subtilisin/kexin type 9 monoclonal antibody has been used to treat dyslipidemia 
      in some refractory nephrotic syndrome cases. As a therapeutic protein, proprotein 
      convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 monoclonal antibody simply deteriorates if 
      stored in inappropriate temperatures or conditions. CASE PRESENTATION: In this 
      article, we present the case of a 16-year-old Thai female with severe combined 
      dyslipidemia secondary to refractory nephrotic syndrome. She received proprotein 
      convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 monoclonal antibody (alirocumab) treatment. 
      However, the drugs were mistakenly frozen in a freezer for up to 17 hours before 
      being stored at 4  degrees C. After using two frozen devices, serum total cholesterol, 
      free proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, and lipoprotein(a) 
      significantly decreased. Nonetheless, the patient developed a skin rash 2 weeks 
      after the second injection and the lesion spontaneously resolved without any 
      treatment approximately 1 month later. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of 
      proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 monoclonal antibody seems to be 
      stable after being stored under freeze-thaw conditions. However, improperly 
      stored drugs should be discarded to avoid any potential undesirable side effects.

TI  - Can we predict orthodontic extraction patterns by using machine learning?
PG  - 552-559
LID - 10.1111/ocr.12641 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the utility of machine learning (ML) in accurately 
      predicting orthodontic extraction patterns in a heterogeneous population. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: The material of this retrospective study consisted of 
      records of 366 patients treated with orthodontic extractions. The dataset was 
      randomly split into training (70%) and test sets (30%) and was stratified 
      according to race/ethnicity and gender. Fifty-five cephalometric and demographic 
      input data were used to train and test multiple ML algorithms. The extraction 
      patterns were labelled according to the previous treatment plan. Random Forest 
      (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms were 
      used to predict the patient's extraction patterns. RESULTS: The highest class 
      accuracy percentages were obtained for the upper and lower 1st premolars (U/L4s) 
      (RF: 81.63%, LR: 63.27%, SVM: 63.27%) and upper 1st premolars only (U4s) 
      extraction patterns (RF: 61.11%, LR: 72.22%, SVM: 72.22%). However, all methods 
      revealed low class accuracy rates (<50%) for the upper 1st and lower 2nd 
      premolars (U4/L5s), upper 2nd and lower 1st premolars (U5/L4s), and upper and 
      lower 2nd premolars (U/L5s) extraction patterns. For the overall accuracy, RF 
      yielded the highest percentage with 54.55%, followed by SVM with 52.73% and LR 
      with 49.09%. CONCLUSION: All tested supervised ML techniques yielded good 
      accuracy in predicting U/L4s and U4s extraction patterns. However, they predicted 
      poorly for the U4/L5s, U5/L4s, and U/L5s extraction patterns. Molar relationship, 
      mandibular crowding, and overjet were found to be the most predictive indicators 
      for determining extraction patterns.

TI  - Intravenous diclofenac and orphenadrine for the treatment of postoperative pain 
      after remifentanil-based anesthesia : A double-blinded, randomized, 
      placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 67-74
LID - 10.1007/s00508-022-02131-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postoperative intravenous diclofenac reduces patient opioid demand 
      and is commonly used in surgical units. Orphenadrine is mainly used in 
      combination with diclofenac for musculoskeletal injuries and postoperative pain 
      control. The objective of this study was to compare the analgesic efficacy of 
      diclofenac-orphenadrine, diclofenac alone and saline. METHODS: We performed 
      a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, single-center 
      clinical study investigating the opioid-sparing effect of a combination of 
      diclofenac and orphenadrine versus diclofenac alone versus isotonic saline 
      solution. Initially 72 patients were included and received total intravenous 
      anesthesia during cruciate ligament surgery. All patients were postoperatively 
      treated with a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) device containing 
      hydromorphone. Pharmacological safety was assessed by laboratory parameters, 
      vital signs, and delirium detection scores. RESULTS: There was no significant 
      difference between the groups in cumulative dose of PCA analgesics required after 
      24 h postsurgery, with 5.90 mg (SD +/- 2.90 mg) in the placebo group, 5.73 mg 
      (SD +/- 4.75 mg) in the diclofenac group, and 4.13 mg (SD +/- 2.57 mg) in the 
      diclofenac-orphenadrine group. Furthermore, there was no significant difference 
      between the groups in cumulative dose of PCA analgesics required 2 h postsurgery 
      (n = 65). Mean dose of hydromorphone required after 2 h was 1.54 mg 
      (SD +/- 0.57 mg) in the placebo group, 1.56 mg (SD +/- 1.19 mg) in the 
      diclofenac-only group, and 1.37 mg (SD +/- 0.78 mg) in the diclofenac-orphenadrine 
      group. However, when comparing the diclofenac-orphenadrine group and the 
      diclofenac group combined to placebo there was a significant reduction in PCA 
      usage in the first 24 h postsurgery. In total, there were 25 adverse events 
      reported, none of which were rated as severe. CONCLUSION: Orphenadrine-diclofenac 
      failed to significantly reduce postoperative opioid requirements. However, in an 
      exploratory post hoc analysis the diclofenac-orphenadrine and the diclofenac 
      group combined versus placebo showed a tendency to reduce opioid demand in 
      postoperative pain control. Further research is required to determine the value 
      of orphenadrine as an adjuvant in a multimodal approach for postoperative pain 
      management.

AB  - Herein, we developed a flexible, low-cost non-enzymatic sweat sensing chip for in 
      situ acquisition of bioinformation in sweat of individuals under exercise 
      conditions to advance personal health monitoring and medication management for 
      patients with Parkinson's disease. This low-cost, flexible, wearable sweat sensor 
      consists of a printed screen electrode modified with g-C(3)N(4) material and an 
      external MSME element. The doping strategy and surface activation strategy of the 
      g-C(3)N(4)-based exhibited efficient glucose oxidase-like activity and 
      electrochemical activity when testing l-dopa and glucose in sweat. The optimized 
      signal was transmitted to a smartphone for processing 12 individuals with 
      simulated dosing, enabling continuous monitoring of l-dopa metabolism in sweat 
      and management of dosing. The generalization ability and robustness of models 
      constructed by methods such as multiple linear regression, artificial neural 
      networks, and convolutional neural networks were compared cross-sectionally. Deep 
      learning models based on artificial neural networks help develop a 
      user-personalized medication administration reminder system, which provides a 
      promising paradigm for reliable medication supervision for Parkinson's patients 
      in the Internet of Things era.

AB  - Rabbit production is increasing in developing countries and can play a crucial 
      role in the fight against poverty. The current work assessed the effect on rabbit 
      does' reproduction and young kits' growth when either Panicum maximum, common 
      name Guinea grass, or Desmodium tortuosum, common name Beggarweed is included in 
      their diet. Diets ReC and GrC (standard granulated diets) served as control 
      diets, formulated for doe Reproduction and kit Growth respectively. The trial 
      diets were diets RePan/GrPan (diet ReC/GrC supplemented with dry P. maximum) and 
      diets ReDes/GrDes (diet ReC/GrC supplemented with dry D. tortuosum). Thirty-six 
      primiparous local breed five-month old rabbit does were randomly allocated to 
      each one of the three dietary treatments. After a 15-day dietary adaptation 
      period, does were each bred to one of 12, related, breeding males. Does were then 
      assigned to individual maternity cages maintaining the same dietary treatment for 
      the ensuing 65 days of the trial (30 days of gestation + 35 days of suckling). 
      Thus, there were a total of 12 replicates per treatment: diet ReC, diet RePan or 
      diet ReDes. At weaning, 72 kits, from the three adult feed treatment groups, 
      were, while maintaining the integrity of the feed group of their individual 
      mothers, divided into 12 blocks with 6 weaned kits per block, with each block 
      allocated one of the three diets. Thus, for each of the three diets there were 
      four separate blocks, i.e., four replicates, each with six group-housed weaned 
      kits that received a growth diet which contained the same supplement or not as 
      their mother diet to which they had access prior to weaning; the control diet GrC 
      (Composition slightly different from Diet ReC composition) and trial diets GrPan 
      and GrDes over a 3-day transition phase were adapted to the weaned kits 
      physiological state and fed for a total of 56 days. The results indicated that 
      the use of D. tortuosum significantly improved (P < 0.05) litter size, milk 
      quantity, and kit survival rate from birth to weaning as compared with both 
      control and RePan diets. The study showed that after weaning, compared with 
      control and GrPan diets, the use of D. tortuosum increased (P < 0.05) the growth 
      performance of weaned kits, improved meat nutritional quality by reducing (P < 
      0.05) cholesterol concentration and increasing (P < 0.05) the n-3 fatty acid 
      proportion, and also reduced the individual kit feed cost to slaughter weight.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An organ shortage is the reason why it is necessary to expand the 
      pool of donors, which can be achieved by using elderly donors. The main goal of 
      this study is to analyze the outcomes of liver transplant (LT) when it is 
      performed with donors older than 75 years. METHODS: We carried out a 
      retrospective case-control study (N = 212) that included LTs with donors older 
      than 75 years (group A, n = 106 cases) that were performed in our center between 
      the years 2010 and 2020. This cohort has been paired off with a similar control 
      group (group B, n = 106) whose donors were significantly younger. A survival 
      analysis using the Kaplan-Meier model was performed. RESULTS: Average (SD) age of 
      donors in group A was statistically greater than group B (A, 79.1 [3.0] years vs 
      B, 54.4 [15.3], P < .001). There were no differences either in the average age of 
      the recipients or in the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score of both groups. 
      Indications for LT were distributed equally in both groups: the most common was 
      cellular hepatocarcinoma followed by alcohol-related cirrhosis. Survival rates 
      for group A were 81%, 78%, and 67%, in 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively, while in 
      group B they were 85%, 76%, and 71%, respectively, without differences found 
      between the groups (P = .57). CONCLUSIONS: Using elderly liver donors is safe, 
      achieving good outcomes in terms of short- and midterm rates of survival.

LID - 905278
AB  - Tuberculosis (TB), caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and 
      malaria, caused by parasites from the Plasmodium genus, are two of the major 
      causes of death due to infectious diseases in the world. Both diseases are 
      treatable with drugs that have microbicidal properties against each of the 
      etiologic agents. However, problems related to treatment compliance by patients 
      and emergence of drug resistant microorganisms have been a major problem for 
      combating TB and malaria. This factor is further complicated by the absence of 
      highly effective vaccines that can prevent the infection with either M. 
      tuberculosis or Plasmodium. However, certain host biological processes have been 
      found to play a role in the promotion of infection or in the pathogenesis of each 
      disease. These processes can be targeted by host-directed therapies (HDTs), which 
      can be administered in conjunction with the standard drug treatments for each 
      pathogen, aiming to accelerate their elimination or to minimize detrimental side 
      effects resulting from exacerbated inflammation. In this review we discuss 
      potential new targets for the development of HDTs revealed by recent advances in 
      the knowledge of host-pathogen interaction biology, and present an overview of 
      strategies that have been tested in vivo, either in experimental models or in 
      patients.

TI  - Multi-photon microscopy for the evaluation of interstitial fibrosis in extended

AB  - INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the initial use of label-free second harmonic 
      generation (SHG) imaging with two-photon excitation (2PE) auto-fluorescence in 
      multiphoton microscopy (MPM) for the quantification of collagen/fibrosis on 
      preimplantation biopsies of extended criteria donors (ECD). MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Twenty preimplantation core biopsies were extracted from 10 donor kidney 
      samples, of which originated from seven donors. Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI) 
      and Remuzzi scores of biopsies were calculated. Collagen parameters measured 
      included quantification by the Collagen Area Ratio in Total Tissue (CART) and 
      qualitative measurements by Collagen Reticulation Index (CRI). RESULTS: Biopsies 
      classified with > 85% KDPI scores had significantly higher CART (p = .011) and 
      lower CRI values (p = .025) than biopsies with </= 85% KDPI scores. Increase in CRI 
      values correlated significantly with rise in recipient creatinine levels 1-year 
      post-transplant (p = .027; 95% CI: 4.635-66.797). CONCLUSION: MPM is an evolving 
      technology that enables the quantification of the amount (CART) and quality (CRI) 
      of collagen deposition in unstained preimplantation biopsies of donor kidneys 
      stratified by KDPI scores. This initial evaluation found significant differences 
      in both parameters between donor kidneys with more or less than 85% KDPI.

AB  - Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is associated with high mortality in coronavirus 
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) but there remains uncertainty about the benefit of 
      anti-coagulation prophylaxis and how to decide when ultrasound screening is 
      indicated. We aimed to determine parameters predicting which COVID-19 patients 
      are at risk of DVT and to assess the benefit of prophylactic 
      anti-coagulation.Adult hospitalized patients with positive severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain 
      reaction (RT-PCR) undergoing venous duplex ultrasound for DVT assessment 
      (n = 451) were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical and laboratory data within 
      72 hours of ultrasound were collected. Using split sampling and a 10-fold 
      cross-validation, a random forest model was developed to find the most important 
      variables for predicting DVT. Different d-dimer cutoffs were examined for 
      classification of DVT. We also compared the rate of DVT between the patients 
      going and not going under thromboprophylaxis.DVT was found in 65 (14%) of 451 
      reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction positive patients. The random 
      forest model, trained and cross-validated on 2/3 of the original sample 
      (n = 301), had area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.91 (95% 
      confidence interval [CI]: 0.85-0.97) for prediction of DVT in the test set 
      (n = 150), with sensitivity = 93% (95%CI: 68%-99%) and specificity = 82% (95%CI: 
      75%-88%). The following variables had the highest importance: d-dimer, 
      thromboprophylaxis, systolic blood pressure, admission to ultrasound interval, 
      and platelets. Thromboprophylaxis reduced DVT risk 4-fold from 26% to 6% 
      (P < .001), while anti-coagulation therapy led to hemorrhagic complications in 14 
      (22%) of 65 patients with DVT including 2 fatal intra-cranial hemorrhages. 
      D-dimer was the most important predictor with area under curve = 0.79 (95%CI: 
      0.73-0.86) by itself, and a 5000 ng/mL threshold at 7 days postCOVID-19 symptom 
      onset had 75% (95%CI: 53%-90%) sensitivity and 81% (95%CI: 72%-88%) specificity. 
      In comparison with d-dimer alone, the random forest model showed 68% versus 32% 
      specificity at 95% sensitivity, and 44% versus 23% sensitivity at 95% 
      specificity.D-dimer >5000 ng/mL predicts DVT with high accuracy suggesting 
      regular monitoring with d-dimer in the early stages of COVID-19 may be useful. A 
      random forest model improved the prediction of DVT. Thromboprophylaxis reduced 
      DVT in COVID-19 patients and should be considered in all patients. Full 
      anti-coagulation therapy has a risk of life-threatening hemorrhage.

TI  - Conservative, surgical, and percutaneous treatment for mitral regurgitation 
      shortly after acute myocardial infarction.

LID - 10.1093/eurheartj/ehab496 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Severe mitral regurgitation (MR) following acute myocardial infarction (MI) 
      is associated with high mortality rates and has inconclusive recommendations in 
      clinical guidelines. We aimed to report the international experience of patients 
      with secondary MR following acute MI and compare the outcomes of those treated 
      conservatively, surgically, and percutaneously. METHODS AND RESULTS: 
      Retrospective international registry of consecutive patients with at least 
      moderate-to-severe MR following MI treated in 21 centres in North America, 
      Europe, and the Middle East. The registry included patients treated 
      conservatively and those having surgical mitral valve repair or replacement 
      (SMVR) or percutaneous mitral valve repair (PMVR) using edge-to-edge repair. The 
      primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. A total of 471 patients were included 
      (43% female, age 73 +/- 11 years): 205 underwent interventions, of whom 106 were 
      SMVR and 99 PMVR. Patients who underwent mitral valve intervention were in a 
      worse clinical state (Killip class >/=3 in 60% vs. 43%, P < 0.01), but yet had 
      lower in-hospital and 1-year mortality compared with those treated conservatively 
      [11% vs. 27%, P < 0.01 and 16% vs. 35%, P < 0.01; adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 
      0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18-0.46, P < 0.01]. Surgical mitral valve 
      repair or replacement was performed earlier than PMVR [median of 12 days from MI 
      date (interquartile range 5-19) vs. 19 days (10-40), P < 0.01]. The immediate 
      procedural success did not differ between SMVR and PMVR (92% vs. 93%, P = 0.53). 
      However, in-hospital and 1-year mortality rates were significantly higher in SMVR 
      than in PMVR (16% vs. 6%, P = 0.03 and 31% vs. 17%, P = 0.04; adjusted HR 3.75, 
      95% CI 1.55-9.07, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Early intervention may mitigate the 
      poor prognosis associated with conservative therapy in patients with post-MI MR. 
      Percutaneous mitral valve repair can serve as an alternative for surgery in 
      reducing MR for high-risk patients.

AB  - The connection between optimal stopping times of American Options and multi-armed 
      bandits is the subject of active research. This article investigates the effects 
      of optional stopping in a particular class of multi-armed bandit experiments, 
      which randomly allocates observations to arms proportional to the Bayesian 
      posterior probability that each arm is optimal (Thompson sampling). The interplay 
      between optional stopping and prior mismatch is examined. We propose a novel 
      partitioning of regret into peri/post testing. We further show a strong 
      dependence of the parameters of interest on the assumed prior probability 
      density.

      outward K(+) currents.

AB  - Myocardial infarction (MI) is the irreversible injury of the myocardium caused by 
      prolonged myocardial ischemia and is a major cause of heart failure and eventual 
      death among ischemic patients. The present study assessed the protective 
      potentials of andrographolide against isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction 
      in rats. Animals were randomly divided into four groups: Control (Ctr) group 
      received 0.9% saline solution once daily for 21 days, Isoproterenol (Iso) group 
      received 0.9% saline solution once daily for 19 days followed by 80 mg/kg/day of 
      isoproterenol hydrochloride solution on day 20 and 21, Andrographolide (Andro) 
      group received 20 mg/kg/day of andrographolide for 21 days, and Andrographolide 
      plus Isoproterenol (Andro + Iso) group received 20 mg/kg/day of andrographolide 
      for 21 days with co-administration of 80 mg/kg/day of isoproterenol hydrochloride 
      solution on day 20 and 21. After all treatments, cardiac-specific parameters that 
      define cardiac health and early subacute MI were measured in all groups using 
      both biophysical and pharmacological assay methods. Isoproterenol administration 
      significantly (P < 0.05) increased cardiac mass indexes, systemic cardiac 
      biomarkers, infarct size and caused cardiac histological alterations; 
      significantly (P < 0.05) increased heart rate, QRS & QTc intervals and caused 
      ST-segment elevation; significantly (P < 0.05) increased myocytes shortening, 
      action potential duration (APD), L-type Ca(2+) current (I(Ca,L)) density and 
      significantly (P < 0.05) decreased transient outward K(+) current (I(to)) density 
      typical of the early subacute MI. Interestingly, pretreatment with 
      andrographolide prevented and or minimized these anomalies, notably, by reducing 
      I(Ca,L) density and increasing I(to) density significantly. Therefore, 
      andrographolide could be seen as a promising therapeutic agent capable of making 
      the heart resistant to early subacute infarction and it could be used as template 
      for the development of semisynthetic drug(s) for cardiac protection against MI.

      Therapeutic Agents.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22094763 [doi]
LID - 4763
AB  - Terpenes-a diverse group of secondary metabolites-constitute the largest class of 
      natural products abundant in almost every plant species. The properties of 
      concrete terpenes and essential oils have been intensively studied due to their 
      widespread use in the pharmaceutical, food and cosmetics industries. Despite the 
      popularity of these aromatic compounds, their derivatives, terpenoids, are still 
      not comprehensively characterized despite exhibiting potent bioactive properties. 
      This review aims to assess the anticancer properties of selected monoterpenes 
      including carvone, carvacrol, perillyl alcohol, perillaldehyde, limonene, menthol 
      and their derivatives while also evaluating potential applications as novel 
      anticancer treatments. Special attention is paid to functional groups that 
      improve the bioactivity of monoterpene molecules. This review also covers the 
      therapeutic potential of deep eutectic solvents that contain monoterpene 
      substances. Taken together, the literature supports the use of monoterpene 
      derivatives in the development of new alternatives for disease treatment and 
      prevention.

TI  - Strain-specific differences in lung tissue viscoelasticity of mechanically 
      ventilated infant Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats.
PG  - L220-L231
LID - 10.1152/ajplung.00100.2020 [doi]
AB  - Rats are often used in ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) models. However, 
      strain-specific susceptibility for VILI has not been elucidated yet. The aim of 
      this study was to demonstrate strain-specific differences in VILI in infant 
      Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats. VILI was compared in 2-wk-old pups after 8 h of 
      protective or injurious ventilation. Pups were ventilated with tidal volumes 
      (V(T)) of  approximately 7 mL/kg and positive end-expiratory pressures (PEEP) of 6 cmH(2)O 
      (V(T)7 PEEP6) or with V(T) of  approximately 21 mL/kg and PEEP 2 cmH(2)O (V(T)21 PEEP2). 
      Interleukin-6, macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2), inflammatory cells, and 
      albumin in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF); histology; and low-frequency 
      forced oscillation technique (LFOT) and pressure-volume (PV) maneuvers were 
      assessed. Alveolar macrophages, neutrophils, and MIP-2 derived from BALF revealed 
      more pronounced VILI after V(T)21 PEEP2 in both strains. LFOT and PV analyses 
      demonstrated rat strain-specific differences both at baseline and particularly in 
      response to V(T)21 PEEP2 ventilation. Sprague-Dawley rats showed higher airway 
      and tissue resistance and elastance values with no difference in hysteresivity 
      between ventilation strategies. Wister rats challenged by V(T)21 PEEP2 
      experienced significantly more energy dissipation when compared with V(T)7 PEEP6 
      ventilation. In conclusion, both rat strains are useful for VILI models. The 
      degree of VILI severity depends on ventilation strategy and selected strain. 
      However, fundamental and time-dependent differences in respiratory system 
      mechanics exist and reflect different lung tissue viscoelasticity. Hence, 
      strain-specific characteristics of the respiratory system need to be considered 
      when planning and interpreting VILI studies with infant rats.

TI  - Iatrogenic Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Following Overdose Norepinephrine 
      Administration During Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.
PG  - 1298-1302
LID - 10.1536/ihj.20-118 [doi]
AB  - Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) is characterized by reversible ventricular 
      dysfunction induced by endogenous and, occasionally, exogenous catecholamine. We 
      present a report on a patient who developed TTC and cardiogenic shock during 
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) secondary to inadvertent norepinephrine 
      administration. His hemodynamic status and cardiac function were totally restored 
      within 1 week after hemodynamic support using intra-aortic balloon pump without 
      sequela. Thus, TTC should be considered once a patient presents with symptoms 
      mimicking acute coronary syndrome (ACS) after catecholamine administration.
