The goal of searchbuildR is to identify overrepresented terms in a set of relevant references for a systematic review or evidence synthesis in general, which can then be applied in a boolean search in a bibliograpic database (e.g. PubMed).

## Installation
You can install searchbuildR from GitHub. The package is currently not released on CRAN, but will be in the future.
```{r installation, eval = FALSE}
library(remotes)
remotes::install_github("https://github.com/IQWiG/searchbuildR")

```

## Example

After installing the package you can launch the Shiny App locally in R:

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
library(searchbuildR)
run_app()
```

The interface looks roughly like this (version 0.0.11):
